**Vendor Documentation  
**

Vendor documentation is required for equipment purchased as part of a project.  It is very important information to have, if the equipment is to be designed, installed, operated and maintained safely and correctly.

Unfortunately, equipment vendors often don’t understand the contractor’s or end-user’s requirements and \`scrimp’ on the quality and quantity of documentation provided with their equipment.  Also, it is helpful if vendor documentation is provided in a format consistent with the end-user’s requirements. So, it is imperative when issuing requests for quotations (RFQ’s) to include the documentation requirements that the successful vendor will be expected to provide with their equipment.

Following are general instructions that should be included in RFQ documents, regarding:

*   Drawings for review.
*   Certified for construction drawings.
*   Equipment manuals.

**Drawings for Review**

The successful Vendor shall submit the following information to the Purchaser for review as follows:

*   Dimensioned general arrangement drawings showing the equipment and required clearances.
*   Dimensioned foundation drawings showing: base plate sizes, bolt hole locations, dead loads, live loads, dynamic loads, wind loads, etc.
*   Component sub-assemblies that are necessary for installation and maintenance.
*   Service piping schematics.
*   Hydraulic schematics and power unit assemblies.
*   Process Flow Diagrams PFD’s), Process & Control (P&C’s) or Process & Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID’s), if applicable.
*   Electrical schematics, wiring diagrams and control panel layouts.
*   Equipment and drive list.
*   Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) data necessary for engineering.
*   Quantities, sizes and weights of main shipping pieces.
*   Shipping, assembly and erection drawings.

Drawing submissions are to be electronic AutoCAD \`.dwg.’ file format (latest edition). Any hard copies are to be sent by courier.

Allow one week for review, excluding delivery and return time.

The manufacturer shall not start fabrication until the review drawings have been returned to him, unless notified otherwise.

Minor shop drawings are not required for review, unless specifically requested.

Every drawing shall include:

*   Client’s name and purchase order number.
*   Client’s drawing number.
*   Client’s equipment name and number.

Drawing revisions and resubmittals will continue until the drawings are deemed to be correct by the Purchaser.

**Certified for Construction Drawings**

Upon satisfactory review by the Purchaser, the Vendor will be requested to submit signed, Certified for Construction (CFC) drawings as follows:

*   One CADD plot
*   The final drawing submission shall be electronic AutoCad ’.dwg’ drawing files (latest edition) provided on a DVD.

**Note**: Drawings must be signed and sealed by a professional engineer registered in the province or state where the installation is being constructed.

**Equipment Manuals**

![read-operators-manual-notice-sign-s-9890](/images/read-operators-manual-notice-sign-s-9890-300x156.png)Upon completion of fabrication, the manufacturer shall provide to the Owner (x) sets of OEM data for each piece of equipment.  The data shall include all items listed in the Vendor’s equipment components list or bill of material.

Equipment manuals shall have the following format:

*   Each piece of equipment shall have its own separate but complete equipment manual.
*   Manuals are to be in 3-ring binders that match standard 3-hole, 8½ x 11 paper.
*   The title of the manual is to be on the front cover and on the leaf. The title must have the name / description of the equipment, equipment number, the final revision date, the vendor’s name, the project title and number.
*   Revision/issue date table at start of manual.
*   Table of contents.
*   Numbers on pages.
*   Dividers that match the table of contents.

Equipment manuals shall have the following content:

*   Safety information / instructions.
*   Complete equipment specifications.
*   Original OEM data and specifications
*   Brochures with photographs of equipment (where applicable).
*   Design Specifications and Performance Guarantees.
*   Testing information.

*   Copy of all CFC drawings.
*   OEM catalogues with generic descriptions of parts and size designations must have the pertinent information and/or correct size highlighted or underlined. Only the pertinent pages should be included.  Information / pages that are not pertinent should be crossed out or clearly indicated that they are not applicable.
*   Pump and fan files must include the above plus operating curve showing calculated operating point, system calculations and other pertinent information.

**Project Drawings for Manuals**

*   All drawings must be legible.
*   Drawings must be the most recent certified revision.
*   B size drawings can be used for D size in the manuals, if legible at that size.
*   B size drawings are to be 3-hole punched and inserted into manual.
