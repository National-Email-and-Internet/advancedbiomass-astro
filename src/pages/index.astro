          Biomass trucks and dumpers are essential components in the biomass supply chain. 
          These specialized vehicles are designed to handle the unique challenges of transporting 
          and unloading various forms of biomass materials, from wood chips and sawdust to 
          agricultural residues and energy crops.

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The design and selection of appropriate trucks and dumping systems is critical for 
          efficient biomass handling operations. Factors such as material characteristics, 
          moisture content, particle size, and facility layout all play important roles in 
          determining the most suitable equipment configuration.
