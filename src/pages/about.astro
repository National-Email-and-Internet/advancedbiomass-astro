          Paul Janze established Advanced Biomass Consulting in 2010, when he realized that with the down-turn in the forest products industry that there was a lot of wood and biomass handling expertise that was being lost due to experienced people being laid-off and retired from mills closing across the country. So, he decided to create a website dedicated to passing on his knowledge about wood and biomass handling. He writes 1-2 articles per year and the response from industry has been great; getting >400 visits every day.

          With the current worldwide interest in the use of biomass for 'green' energy purposes, there are a lot of interested and well-intentioned but woefully inexperienced people vying for various grants and proposing new projects, but who have little or no experience with biomass.

            Biomass is not an easy material to handle. It appears in a myriad of species, forms and sizes; it knits together, doesn't flow well, consolidates and packs easily; it can have a wide range of moisture contents, basic and bulk densities and calorific values; it will freeze; it is very dusty, catches fire easily and is self-combustible; it can contain all manner of contaminants; it can be quite fragile and care must be taken not to degrade the material.
