Mr. Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products industry.
</p> <p>
His early experience in mill maintenance, equipment design and industrial engineering is a great benefit as he fully appreciates the requirements of a mill from an operations and maintenance perspective.
</p> <p>
Paul is the principal / owner of '<strong><em>Advanced Biomass Consulting Inc.</em></strong>' (ABC) located in Langley, BC, Canada. Paul and ABC specialize in conceptual and detail design of wood and biomass handling systems primarily for the energy and pulp and paper industries.
</p> <p>
Paul worked for 21 years for Sandwell Engineering (now Ausenco) in Vancouver, BC as a Senior Specialist, Industrial Material Handling with the last 4 years as Manager, Wood and Biomass Handling, where his responsibilities included business development, design staff supervision and review of industrial material handling projects. Additionally, Paul had direct involvement in feasibility studies and projects including, cost estimating, process conceptual design, detail design, project co-ordination and scheduling, construction assistance and mill 'trouble-shooting' of material handling systems primarily for power generation facilities, pulpmill woodrooms, sawmills and other industrial facilities.
</p> <p>
Prior to his time at Sandwell, Paul worked for (13) years with H.A. Simons (now Wood PLC / Amec Foster Wheeler) in Vancouver, BC as a senior designer and small-project manager. And prior to that about (10) years in equipment manufacturing and mill maintenance.
</p> <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 my-6"> <p>
His experience includes: biomass handling and processing including forest residuals, log handling, chip handling and screening, woodwaste from processing plants, wood pellets, wood strands, corn stover, straw and poultry litter, deinked pulp, sludge and biosolids; municipal solid waste (MSW); and lime rock and dust, coal, coke, ash and alumina handling. He has a keen interest in technologies which recover and utilize waste materials and convert them into products such as wood pellets. Paul's specialties are fibre flow analysis, mass balances, process optimization and designing novel solutions to complex conveying problems.
</p> </div> <p>
Paul places great value on teamwork and on the interaction between client and engineer, recognizing the essential need to involve the client at all stages of the engineering process. He particularly enjoys visiting mills to view the operating problems first-hand, and to solicit the opinions of those whose responsibility it is to operate and maintain the equipment.
</p> <p>
Paul likes to be involved with a project from early conceptualization through definition planning, detail engineering, construction, start-up and optimization. He is very cognizant of the need for a process to be functionally sound, operationally efficient and cost effective.
</p> <p>
Paul has developed several novel pieces of equipment, most recently a helical chute designed to allow fragile materials such as wood pellets or agricultural products to slide into storage silos, thereby reducing their velocity, subsequent impacts and product degradation.
</p> <p class="font-semibold">
Paul has completed more than 180 projects and studies in his career, most of them in wood and biomass handling.
