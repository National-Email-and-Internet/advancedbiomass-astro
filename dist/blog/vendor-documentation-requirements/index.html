**</p>
<p>Vendor documentation is required for equipment purchased as part of a project.  It is very important information to have, if the equipment is to be designed, installed, operated and maintained safely and correctly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, equipment vendors often don’t understand the contractor’s or end-user’s requirements and `scrimp’ on the quality and quantity of documentation provided with their equipment.  Also, it is helpful if vendor documentation is provided in a format consistent with the end-user’s requirements. So, it is imperative when issuing requests for quotations (RFQ’s) to include the documentation requirements that the successful vendor will be expected to provide with their equipment.</p>
<p>Following are general instructions that should be included in RFQ documents, regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drawings for review.</li>
<li>Certified for construction drawings.</li>
<li>Equipment manuals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawings for Review</strong></p>
<p>The successful Vendor shall submit the following information to the Purchaser for review as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimensioned general arrangement drawings showing the equipment and required clearances.</li>
<li>Dimensioned foundation drawings showing: base plate sizes, bolt hole locations, dead loads, live loads, dynamic loads, wind loads, etc.</li>
<li>Component sub-assemblies that are necessary for installation and maintenance.</li>
<li>Service piping schematics.</li>
<li>Hydraulic schematics and power unit assemblies.</li>
<li>Process Flow Diagrams PFD’s), Process &#x26; Control (P&#x26;C’s) or Process &#x26; Instrumentation Diagrams (P&#x26;ID’s), if applicable.</li>
<li>Electrical schematics, wiring diagrams and control panel layouts.</li>
<li>Equipment and drive list.</li>
<li>Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) data necessary for engineering.</li>
<li>Quantities, sizes and weights of main shipping pieces.</li>
<li>Shipping, assembly and erection drawings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawing submissions are to be electronic AutoCAD `.dwg.’ file format (latest edition). Any hard copies are to be sent by courier.</p>
<p>Allow one week for review, excluding delivery and return time.</p>
