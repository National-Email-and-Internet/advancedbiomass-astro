This is mainly due to historical ties with the United Kingdom (before metrication), the traditional use of the imperial system of measurement in Canada, close proximity to the United States, and to public opposition to metrication during the transition period.\"\n\nThis is a direct quote from an article titled \"Metrication in Canada\" on Wikipedia, but the emphasis in italics is mine.\n\n46 years later in 2016, the measurement system is still a mixed bag, partly metric and partly imperial. And, everyone, including clients, engineers, other consultants, regulatory bodies, vendors, manufacturers and contractors all interpret the measurement designation requirements differently, and if not controlled can wreak havoc with a complex project.\n\nThe first issue to be resolved when starting a project is determining which measurement system to use as a base for the project. This may already be decided for you, if the client already has a measurement system in place. The second and more controversial issue to resolve is determining how the various measurements should be interpreted and specified.\n\nI am a great believer in specifying measurements and components as they truly are; that is, if the components are metric, describe them as metric and if imperial, then describe them as imperial.\n\nNothing is more frustrating than getting a drawing or specification where imperial fasteners have been described in metric terms, or vice versa. For example, if it's a 1\" UNC bolt, then it should not be described as a 25mm UNC bolt. Nor should a 3 7/16\" dia. shaft be described as a 87.3mm dia. shaft.\n\nSome clients (usually government corporations) insist on a policy that everything is to be specified in metric terms, with the result being that you end up with some ugly descriptions which are invariably confusing.\n\nEvery project requires guidelines to be established at the beginning of the project prescribing how items and measurements are to be described. Over the years, I've developed the following general guidelines, which when presented to the project stakeholders, always provoke considerable discussion, particularly between the various engineering disciplines. It is a discussion that must involve the client / end user, as he is the one who will have to live with the outcomes when the project is complete.\n\nOne argument I've lost many times and finally no longer contest, is the practice of describing imperial steel members in metric terms. In Canada, steel is manufactured to imperial dimensions but in keeping with the CISC steel book, a C8x11.5 channel is described as a C200x17 channel and an L4x4x¼ angle is described as an L100x100x6.3 angle. Silly, but true.\n\nThe underlying premise when specifying metric or imperial dimensions, should be \"Use common sense\".\n\n## Guidelines for a Metric Project\n\nFollowing are the guidelines I present to the project stakeholders for discussion when starting a metric project.\n\n- This project will be metric, and ISO metric units will be used where applicable. However, please use common sense with regard to metrication.\n\n- Component designation should reflect reality. If components are manufactured in imperial units, specify them in imperial units; the same applies to components manufactured in metric units.\n\n- There should be no 'hard conversion' to metric purely for the sake of metrication.\n\n- Units of measure commonly in use at the client's facility are to be used where appropriate.\n\n- Drawings prepared for regulatory purposes (permits, etc.) will be in the units specified by the regulatory body.\n\n- The end result is a 'mixed bag' of Imperial and metric designations; however, that reflects reality.\n\n- Electrical and control schematics and loop drawings will be A3 size with drawing borders set-up for this project with the client's name and logo.\n\n- All other drawings will be metric in A1 size.\n\n- The following should be dictated by the client, and if the client doesn't have a standard, then the lead engineer:\n\n- Drawings, drawing standards and drawing scales should be in the client's format.\n\n- Naming conventions should be per the client's format.\n\n- Drawing, equipment and device numbering should be in the client's format.\n\n- Process Flow Diagrams (PFD's), Process and Control Diagrams (P&C's), Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID's) shall use the client's symbols.\n\n- Electrical schematics shall use the client's symbols.\n\n- Hydraulic schematics shall use the client's symbols.\n\n- A drawing list will be prepared for each discipline. See document controller for drawing numbering.\n\n- The 12-hour clock will be used, unless noted otherwise.\n\n- Date format will be day/month/year (16-Feb-2016), unless noted otherwise.\n\n- All dimensions such as height, width, length, elevations, diameters and radii will be in millimeters (mm). eg. – 30000 or meters 30.000 (m) per the client's standard.\n\n- Angles will be specified in degrees (°).\n\n- Area will be specified in square meters (m²), or hectares; and volume in cubic meters (m³).\n\n- Where dimensions are converted from imperial to metric, use discretion in the conversion. Keep the level of accuracy expressed, within the level of manufacturing tolerance or placement required. Let's not see decimals of mm. eg. – The hard conversion of 10′-0″ is 3048.8, but ask yourself if 3048 isn't accurate enough; and if it's not critical, 3050 will be fine. Just make sure cumulative dimensions add up.\n\n- Conveyor speeds will be expressed in metric terms, in meters per second (mps), or meters per minute (mpm) per the client's standard.\n\n- Weights are to be in kilograms (kg) or tonnes (t) and material densities in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³).\n\n- Product flows are to be expressed in metric terms. eg. – cubic meters per hour (m³/h), bone-dry tonnes per hour (BDt/h) or green (wet) tonnes per hour (t/h).\n\n- Material moisture contents are to be expressed in percentage (%), wet basis.\n\n- Air flows can be in cubic meters per hour (m³/h), or cubic feet per minute, per the client's standard.\n\n- Forces are to be expressed in kilo-newtons (kN).\n\n- Torque is to be expressed in newton-meters (Nm).\n\n- Hydraulic flows and pressures are to be in imperial, as most pump sizes are expressed in American gallons (USG), and pressures expressed in kilopascals (kPa) or pounds per square inch (psig) per the client's standard.\n\n- Fluid volume is to be expressed in litres (l).\n\n- Temperatures are to be in Celsius (°C).\n\n- Energy will be expressed in megajoules, megawatts, or Btu's and horsepower, or per the client's standard.\n\n- All steel shapes will be called up as per the CISC Handbook of Steel Construction (metric designations), even though the steel is actually made to imperial dimensions.\n\n- Pipe sizes are to be expressed in imperial if imperial, metric if metric.\n\n- All precision shafting will be specified in inches. ie. – 3 7/16″, 3 15/16″, etc.\n\n- Specify turned-down shaft-ends in units compatible with the matching mechanical components. eg. – in inches to suit inch series bearings and sprockets; in mm to suit metric sized gearboxes or hydraulic motors.\n\n- Fits and finishes should be in metric terms, unless the basic dimension is imperial.\n\n- Specify keyways in inches, unless they are truly metric.\n\n- In order to be consistent, the manufacturer's equipment designations are to be used. eg. – a conveyor chain designated by the manufacturer as \"HD480-S x 8″ pitch\", should be called-up as such.\n\n- Roller chain pitches are to be expressed in inches, unless truly metric. eg. – ANSI 120 chain, 1 1/2″ pitch. Roller chain lengths are to be expressed in pitches with mm in brackets.\n\n- Sprocket and sheave pitch diameters are to be in inches, unless truly metric.\n\n- Conveyor components such as belting widths or pulleys are to be expressed in inches, if they are imperial. Lengths of belting will be in metric terms (metres).\n\n- Conveyor idlers shall be called up in inches, if imperial idlers are used; or in mm if metric idlers are used.\n\n- Screw conveyor diameters and pitches will be in inches to coincide with the vendor's dimensions. Lengths would be in metric.\n\n- Thread form will be the 'Unified Series'. ie. – UNC or UNF.\n\n- Mechanical fasteners will be zinc-plated, SAE grade 5 hex head cap screws but can be called up thus: 3/4 bolts.\n\n- Where metric threads are required, metric grade 8.8 bolts will be used and will be called up in mm. eg. – M24x3.\n\n- Bolt hole sizes will be specified in mm. eg. – (6) 25 mm ∅ holes for 7/8″ bolts.\n\n- Pipe threads will be American (NPT), unless truly metric.\n\n- Electric motors are to be the NEMA standard and dimensions are in inches. Motor sizes are to be expressed in horsepower (hp), unless truly metric (kW).\n\n- Rotational speeds are to be in revolutions per minute (rpm).\n\n- Paint thickness will be expressed in mils, dry film thickness (DFT).\n\n- Duplicate imperial measurements are permissible, but will be used only where necessary for clarity and only in order to be consistent with other reference drawings and are not to be used excessively. The duplicate measurement must be enclosed in brackets.\n\nBe prepared for lots of discussion, but if you can get the project stakeholders to agree on all these items early on when the project is being set up, you will save yourself a lot of grief later.\n\nOnce agreement has been achieved, the \"Guide to Metrication\" must be distributed to all stakeholders.\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

Historically, most sawmills in BC were accustomed to processing 'green' wood with moisture contents of 40 – 55%, wet basis. While not unknown, fires were not a common experience with such wet wood, and explosions were unheard of. So, the fires and explosions in northern BC in 2011 and 2012, which resulted in the total destruction of two large sawmills, multiple deaths and injuries, is great cause for concern. Everyone is asking, \"What happened?\" The relevant safety authorities are currently investigating both incidents and at this point in time, firm causes have yet to be identified.\n\nThere has been speculation that dust accumulations resulting from the processing of dry (\u003C25%), Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) killed wood were contributors to the two explosions. The Mountain Pine Beetle has always been present, but nature has kept them in check through long periods of very cold weather. Over the last two decades the amount of timber being killed by the MPB has grown and has reached astronomical proportions in BC, with more than 60% of the pine resource being killed, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest being decimated. After dying, the pine trees dry out to the ambient humidity level. The longest-dead trees that are still standing are quite dry with moisture contents \u003C25%.\n\nAs the MPB plague spread through a region there was a rush to mill the most recently killed trees before their value diminished too drastically. In affected regions after 20 years, sawmills are now processing pine that has been dead for a few years and is quite dry. So, the amount of MPB killed wood being processed is increasing at the same time as the dryness of the wood is decreasing. The dry MPB killed wood is very brittle and tends to shatter and generates large quantities of dust, which can overwhelm dust collection systems.\n\nAs are most BC interior mills, both destroyed mills were processing large quantities of MPB wood and were reported to have been very dusty. Since these two serious accidents, it has been learned that in recent years there have been at least five other less calamitous explosions in sawmills processing MPB killed wood. In these incidents, there were varying amounts of property damage but no injuries.\n\nUsed to processing benign 'green' wood, the sawmilling industry has been caught somewhat 'flat-footed' by the potential for disastrous consequences from the handling of dry MPB killed wood. However, since the calamitous fires and explosions, government and industry has responded remarkably and has taken steps to avoid their reoccurrence.\n\nOne effect of these two tragedies has been to put a focus on wood dust generation and accumulations in sawmills. As a consequence, the provincial government has ordered all mills to conduct dust safety surveys and WorkSafe BC and industry have compiled a document describing the best industry standards for dust, fire and explosion control.\n\nPanelboard plants and wood finishing plants are very familiar with the fire and explosion risks associated with handling dry wood products. There is probably no dust so explosive as dry sander dust, which is common in panelboard plants. Consequently, most panelboard plants and wood finishing plants have long mastered the safe handling of explosive dusts. Still, not many years ago, one particleboard plant in Quebec was destroyed by dust explosions.\n\nHistorically, wood pellet production was a small industry with more than its share of fires and explosions. However with the emphasis on green energy, wood pellet production has skyrocketed and very large plants are being constructed. There have been several recent major fires and explosions in wood pellet manufacturing, shipping, receiving, storage and power plant facilities. These new facilities are learning that they have to employ safe handling practices for dry wood materials.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to describe to the newcomer to the industry some of the safety issues associated with handling dry woody biomass and provide general guidelines for dust control, spark, fire and explosion detection and suppression. Relevant codes, regulations and useful resources are listed at the end of the article.\n\n## Fire / Explosion Risks\n\nIt is well known that when dry, wood will readily burn. Additionally, due to microbial / bacteriological action and oxidation in certain storage conditions, wood can heat up to the point where it will self-combust. The nature of the material being stored, moisture content, particle size, air flow through the pile, compaction, size of storage pile, and contaminants can all contribute to spontaneous combustion.\n\nWet biomass will also burn. Some of the fastest moving fires have involved green sawdust soaked with hydraulic oil; all it takes is a spark or flame to get the fire started. And, smouldering fires in large, wet hog fuel piles are common even during very cold winters.\n\nThe causes of biomass fires are numerous. All you need is fuel, oxygen and a source of ignition. For a dust explosion / deflagration to occur, two additional factors are required: mixing the explosive dust with air in the necessary concentration and confining the mixture in a container or structure.\n\nSome milling processes generate sparks. High speed hogs, grinders and chippers are used to process biomass and while doing so, can generate a lot of dust if the wood is dry. If a piece of metal or even a stone falls into the equipment, sparks can be produced, which can ignite the airborne dust. So, it is important to contain and collect the dust, decrease the metal and rock contamination at source and utilize metal removing equipment before the milling process at the plant.\n\nIf not controlled, dust will build-up around belts, pulleys, bearings, etc. Friction can result in enough heat build-up to start fires.\n\nNo wood handling process is dust-free. With even the best designed, constructed, operated and maintained system, fugitive dusting will occur. Very fine, airborne dust can escape and float in the air for a long time before settling out. And, whether it takes a day, a week or a month, dust will build-up. Accumulations of fine dust are easily disturbed and can become airborne, creating an explosive atmosphere. So, proactive clean-up procedures are required to minimize dust accumulations.\n\nAccumulations of fine dust are easily ignited, particularly by 'hot work' maintenance practices, so it is essential to wet areas down before starting 'hot work' and have a fire watch posted during and after the hot work.\n\nEven clean-up operations can result in fires and explosions. An inexperienced worker utilizing compressed air or an air blower to 'blow-down' an area can stir up the fine dust and re-entrain it in the air stream; and if it drifts to an area where 'hot work' is underway, the results can be explosive.\n\nShould a small fire occur, it is common practice for workers to use a fire hose to put the fire out, but the stream of water can cause very dry dust accumulations to become airborne and which can be ignited by the fire resulting in a local primary explosion / deflagration.\n\nA local primary explosion can shake a building causing more very fine dust accumulations to fall off roof beams or wall girts, which if ignited can result in a chain reaction of explosions propagating from one area to another. These secondary explosions can destroy the entire building.\n\nElectrostatic electricity can build-up in equipment and sudden discharges are enough to ignite a dust cloud, so grounding / bonding equipment is important.\n\nFire and explosions resulting from handling dry wood are a real risk, consequently, it is necessary to assess the risks and utilize appropriate asset protection measures.\n\n## Asset Protection\n\nAsset protection includes:\n\n- Risk Assessment\n- Prevention\n- Dust Control with spark detection and suppression\n- Fire detection and suppression\n- Explosion detection and suppression\n- Gas detection / Monitoring\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nAsset protection is a complex topic and one could write a lengthy manual to cover it completely. There are specialists available to help you with assessing the risks and making recommendations; so when first planning a project, engage an engineering company specializing in risk assessment and asset protection early in your project definition. What you don't want to do is to underestimate the types and amounts of asset protection systems required.\n\nPlant areas fall into various area classifications, from those with low risk of fire or explosions to those with a high risk. The asset protection specialist will be able to assist you in determining the classification that is appropriate for each area in your plant. Each classification has certain requirements for equipment with respect to bonding / grounding, and electrical classification.\n\nMost areas in a wood pellet plant are in the highest risk classification, Class II, Div. 1, Group G. For these areas, all electrical equipment (lighting fixtures, switches, sensors, etc.) must be designed and rated for the area and must be in CSA approved explosion proof enclosures or connected to Intrinsically Safe (IS) Barriers located in non-classified areas. All motors must be TEXP NEMA Premium efficiency motors, CSA approved for Class II, Div. 1, Group G. Armoured cables, rated for hazardous locations, are used for power, control and instrumentation wiring.\n\n### Prevention\n\nThe processes involved in a dust explosion are extremely complex and hard to predict. However, explosions can be prevented by eliminating the fuel or ignition sources, by controlling dust concentrations or by limiting the oxygen necessary to sustain combustion / deflagration. Additionally, the potential effects of an explosion can be controlled by the design of the enclosure. The best countermeasure against fire or explosions is to prevent them from happening. Following are a few general recommendations.\n\n- Reduce the generation of dust by keeping speeds low and designing chutes to minimize impacts and product degradation.\n- Reduce the likelihood of fires by daily vacuuming up spills and accumulated dust, particularly away from heat generators such as lights, heaters, motors, etc.\n- Provide deflectors (>60°) over hard to reach places such as purlins, roof beams and girts to prevent the build-up of dust on hard to clean, horizontal surfaces.\n- Reduce the explosive environment inside enclosed structures by maintaining a good airflow through structures / enclosures to reduce airborne dust concentrations below dangerous levels.\n- Contain the dust inside equipment and evacuate airborne dust from the equipment; collect the dust and dispose of it.\n- **Note:** Do not use air blowers or compressed air to 'blow down' or clean equipment, as that will create an airborne dust cloud that in the correct concentration can be explosive.\n\nReduce potential ignition sources by:\n\n- Utilizing static conducting materials for belting, liners, grease, etc.\n- Ground and bond all equipment and conveyors to drain away static electricity.\n- Remove tramp metal from the product flow.\n- Line chutes with non-sparking materials.\n- Maintain equipment to reduce areas of friction.\n- Don't mix wet and dry biomass within the same storage pile, as that can promote biological action and self-heating.\n- Measure the temperature of stored material and monitor temperature trends. A sudden increase can be indicative of 'runaway' heating which can quickly lead to self-ignition.\n- Aeration can be used to keep the temperature level of stored biomass from reaching dangerous levels; however, once temperatures reach the 'runaway' level, aeration systems need to be turned off as they will provide O2 to feed the fire.\n- Monitor the gas levels inside biomass enclosures for CO, CO2, and O2, as changes in these can be indicative of fire.\n\nThe design parameters for dust control systems should include:\n\n- Totally enclosing the equipment to contain the product and to give heavier dust particles time to settle out.\n- Keep the equipment under a negative pressure so that there is a net inflow of air into the equipment, thereby reducing fugitive dusting.\n- Remove dust laden air permanently from the system and collect the dust in containers for removal from the site.\n- Do not reintroduce the dust back into the conveyor system where it would only be re-entrained at the next transfer point.\n\nDust control systems generally include the following:\n\n- A dust collector with sprinklers, explosion vents, rotary airlock and fan, preferably located outdoors.\n- Ductwork has pick-up hoods, clean-outs, test ports, visual airflow indicators and blast gates to balance the airflows.\n- An airflow transmitter is mounted on the duct between the dust collector and fan.\n- IR spark / flame detectors and a quenching water spray and fast-acting (milliseconds) abort gate are located in the main duct before the collector. Dry chemical suppressors are utilized where water cannot be used.\n- A disposal bin is provided below the collector rotary airlock.\n\n## Fire Detection and Suppression\n\nFire detection and suppression systems should comprise the following measures:\n\n- Conveyors with heat sensing wires and sprinkler systems.\n- Infra-red (IR) heat sensors in particularly sensitive areas.\n- Storage silos and bins with temperature and gas monitoring systems and aeration systems, as well as inert gas injection nozzles for fire suppression.\n- All structures and galleries must have sprinkler systems, and fire hose stations located near the entrances to structures.\n- In warm climates, wet sprinkler systems can be used, but in cold climates, dry systems will be required.\n- Fire alarm systems interlocked to shutdown process and HVAC equipment.\n- Fire hydrants should be located outside the structures.\n\n## Deflagration / Explosion Detection and Suppression\n\n- Wherever possible, equipment such as dust collectors that are susceptible to dust explosions, should be physically isolated from other equipment or structures. In order to prevent deflagrations / explosions from propagating to upstream or downstream equipment, the following isolating devices can be used:\n  - Rotary airlocks\n  - Isolation hoppers and gates\n  - Fast-acting isolation gates\n  - Material plugs\n  - Chemical isolation\n  - Blast walls around susceptible equipment\n\n- Explosion flame-front detectors or pressure detectors trigger fast-acting (milliseconds), dry chemical suppressors to reduce the effects of and extinguish deflagrations. Whenever explosion detectors are activated, the associated process equipment is immediately stopped.\n- Chemical explosion suppression is provided to reduce the effects of explosions occurring inside equipment, and chemical explosion isolation is provided to prevent the propagation of explosions into upstream and downstream equipment.\n- Deflagration venting reduces the explosion pressures inside structures by providing a pathway for the pressure to escape from affected structures or equipment.\n\n## Gas Detection / Monitoring\n\n- CO and CO2 gas levels can be indicative of smouldering biomass, so measure and trend these gas levels.\n- Methane (CH4) is a product of biomass degradation, so measure and trend CH4.\n- Ventilate enclosed spaces to evacuate harmful gasses. Where there is the possibility of CO, CO2 and CH4 generation, it is necessary to measure these and O2 levels in adjacent enclosed areas for personnel protection.\n\n## Reference Codes and Regulations\n\nThe requirements for asset protection are highly regulated falling under many jurisdictions in Canada, including but not limited to:\n\n- National Building Code (NBC)\n- National Fire Code (NFC)\n- Local building codes\n- Canadian Electrical Code\n- National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), particularly the following codes:\n  - NFPA 68, Standard on Explosion Protection by Venting\n  - NFPA 69, Standard on Explosion Prevention Systems\n  - NFPA 70, National Electrical Code, (particularly the sections on area classifications)\n  - NFPA 77, Standard on Static Electricity\n  - NFPA 499, Recommended Practice for the Classification of Combustible Dusts and of Hazardous Locations for Electrical Installations\n  - NFPA 654, Standard for the Prevention of Fire and Dust Explosions from the Manufacturing, Processing and Handling of Combustible Particulate Solids\n  - NFPA 664, Standard for the Prevention of Fire and Explosions in Wood Processing and Woodworking Facilities\n\nIt is highly recommended that an asset protection specialist be retained not only to provide help with the design of asset protection systems, but also to provide assistance navigating the 'regulatory waters'.\n\n## Other Helpful Resources\n\nPlant insurers such as FM Global have their own requirements. For technical guidance on some of the issues, see the following FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets:\n\n- FM 7-10, Wood Processing and Woodworking Facilities\n- FM 7-11, Belt Conveyors\n- FM 7-17, Explosion Protection Systems\n- FM 7-73, Dust Collectors and Collection Systems\n- FM 7-76, Prevention and Mitigation of Combustible Dust Explosions and Fire\n- FM 8-27, Storage of Wood Chips\n\nThe Industrial Accident Prevention Association (IAPA) has an excellent paper titled \"Static Electricity\" published in 2008.\n\nAfter the two sawmill tragedies mentioned above, WorkSafe BC and industry compiled a document titled \"Wood Dust in Sawmills, Compilation of Industry Best Practices\", published May 4,2012, which describes industry best practices with regards to \"wood dust clean-up, control and associated fire prevention and protection measures\". This lengthy document has a very good list of excellent references.\n\nThe BC Forest Safety Council has a Basic Audit and Safety Evaluation (BASE) program for all wood handling operations and in 2011 extended the program to include guidelines for the assessment and safety evaluation of wood pellet mills. \"Base Audit, Draft Guidelines Version 2.1, Pellet Industry Addendum\".\n\nThe Wood Pellet Association of Canada (WPAC) has written a report titled \"Determination of Explosibility of Dust Layers in Pellet Manufacturing Plants\", which provides guidelines for assessing the risk posed by dust accumulations. While targeted at pellet plants, many of the observations and recommendations are applicable to other wood processing facilities.","src/content/posts/biomass-dust-fire-and-explosion-control.md","de0843496ed1f1a1",{"html":65,"metadata":66},"\u003Ch2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Fires have always been a problem in wood processing plants, particularly in those that handle dry material, including wood finishing plants, panelboard plants and wood pellet facilities; less so in sawmills.

Woody biomass, called 'hog fuel', has long been utilized as a fuel in cogeneration plants at pulp and paper mills, where it was traditionally a waste product from the processing of clean white wood chips used to make pulp. While many practical lessons have been learned about what is appropriate for hog fuel storage, generally little documented study has been directed at storage practices, primarily due to its abundance and historical status as a waste product with next to zero value.\n\nHowever, hog fuel is the basic feedstock for biomass-fired power plants and is becoming a hot commodity and it is the single biggest on-going cost item for energy plants. How it is handled has an effect on quality, so a greater understanding of hog fuel storage requirements is required.\n\n![Bark Pile](/images/biomass-pile.jpg)\n*Bark Pile*\n\nBiomass is not an easy material to handle. It appears in a myriad of species, forms and sizes; it knits together, doesn't flow well, consolidates and packs easily; it can have a wide range of moisture contents, basic and bulk densities and calorific values. It will freeze; it is very dusty, catches fire easily and is self-combustible; it can contain all manner of contaminants.\n\nWhat makes good hog fuel? When 'greenfield' plants are designed, boiler technology is usually selected based on the type of fuel available. When existing boilers are converted to burn biomass in 'brownfield' projects, the fuel must be matched to the existing boiler in order to minimize required boiler modifications. While individual fuel characteristics can vary considerably, there are four main fuel quality parameters that must be met to ensure good boiler operation, including maintaining:\n\n- Consistent moisture content\n- Consistent particle size\n- Minimal contamination in order to minimize ash content\n- Consistent calorific, proximate and ultimate values\n\n## 1. Moisture Content of Fuel\n\nGenerally the dryer the fuel, the less energy is required to evaporate the remaining water and the more energy is available for generating heat or power. The amount of moisture contained in the incoming fuel has a great effect on the efficiency of the combustor, which is designed to operate best with a fuel that is maintained within a particular moisture band. Move outside that band and the boiler and/or its emissions control system is likely to have operating problems. For example, a boiler designed for fuel at 25% MC might have a burner efficiency approaching 80%; and if presented with fuel at 50% MC the burner efficiency could drop as low as 65%.\n\n![Rotary Bark Dryer](/images/rotary-dryer-graphic1.jpg)\n*Rotary Bark Dryer*\n\nThe most important requirement is that the moisture content is maintained as close to the ideal level for the particular boiler. Too dry fuel can cause as many operating problems as fuel that is too wet.\n\nIf your fuel is inherently wet, either the boiler must be designed to accommodate the wet fuel or the fuel must be dried prior to the boiler. In both cases, energy is required to drive-off the moisture, and finding the least costly way to do so can be a challenge. Drum dryers have been used to dry fuel before combustion, but in most cases that has proven uneconomical.\n\nBubbling fluidized bed boilers handle wet fuel the best, as the wet fuel is instantly dried in the sand bed just prior to combustion. All non-natural methods of drying the fuel require costly energy. However with enough space and time, wet fuel can be dried naturally, if care is taken with the design of the fuel storage system.\n\n## 2. Particle Size\n\n![Bubbling Fluidized Bed Boiler](/images/bfb-graphic1.jpg)\n*Bubbling Fluidized Bed Boiler*\n\nThe target biomass particle size is dictated by the type of combustor. Suspension burning requires the fuel to be dried and ground-up or pulverized to a very small size so that it can be blown into the boiler. Most fluidized-bed boilers generally require their fuel to be ground-up to a particle size \u003C63mm (\u003C2 ½\"); (see CEN P63 specification). Pin-hole grates or vibrating grates tolerate material \u003C100mm (\u003C4\"); (see CEN P100 specification). Both P63 and P100 specifications call for specific size distributions with minimum allowable amounts of acceptable sized material and specific limits of the amounts of both undersize and oversize material. For the best combustor and emissions control operation, the hog fuel particle size being fed to the combustor should be kept within those limits.\n\nParticle size within a biomass pile also has a big effect on moisture absorption, heat build-up, heat dissipation and dry fibre losses. Piles containing a large amount of fines absorb greater amounts of water, generally heat up faster due to greater microbial action, and restrict air movement through the pile, thereby limiting heat dissipation; all of this leading to increased dry fibre loss and possibly spontaneous combustion.\n\nConversely, piles consisting of large wood chunks heat up more slowly, permit better air flow due to the large voids, dissipate the heat faster due to better air circulation, have lower rates of microbial action and lower dry fibre losses.\n\nIt is recommended that for long storage periods that fuel be stored in fairly large particles and only re-processed to the final size shortly before usage in the boiler.\n\nRegular fuel sampling is necessary to ensure the incoming fuel meets contractual requirements and also to ensure that the fuel being fed to the boiler meets the proper size distribution.\n\n## 3. Contamination\n\n![Scalping Disc Screen](/images/scalping-disc-screen.jpg)\n*Scalping Disc Screen*\n\nAssume that the incoming raw material will be contaminated with dirt, rocks, grit and metal; and snow and ice in northern climates; the amounts of which should be minimized prior to the fuel being introduced into the combustor. Ferrous metal is relatively easy to remove with self-cleaning magnets, but to be effective, care must be taken with magnet placement.\n\n![Self-Cleaning Magnet](/images/self-cleaning-magnet.jpg)\n*Self-Cleaning Magnet*\n\nLarge rocks and frozen lumps can be removed with disc scalping screens. Dirt, grit, snow, ice, small stones and other such small particles are more difficult to remove. Equipment is available to segregate and remove this material, but it is generally a costly enterprise. It might be best to select a boiler that can handle a certain amount of this material.\n\nHowever, the best solution is to utilize methods that minimize the amounts of these materials getting into the hog fuel in the first place, including:\n\n- Don't store processed fuel on un-paved surfaces where they can pick up rocks, dirt and grit.\n- Load directly into trucks or storage bins when making the hog fuel.\n- Ensure that the contamination that builds-up on delivery trucks does not end up in the hog fuel.\n- Store the material under cover whenever possible to minimize the amount of snow accumulation.\n\nWoody biomass can also contain other contaminants that cannot be removed prior to combustion. For example, in coastal British Columbia, Canada, logs are transported by water in log 'booms' along ocean channels and while doing so absorb salt water. Also, bark and wastewood is often transported in open-topped barges where salt-spray splashes over the barge walls. When burned in a boiler, salt can cause problems with the boiler equipment if the proper metallurgy is not used. Also, appropriate emissions control equipment must be utilized that can handle the salt.\n\n## 4. Calorific, Proximate and Ultimate Values\n\nThe most important quality parameter is the calorific value of the fuel; the higher the value the less fuel required, with the converse being true. Also, different fuels will have different proximate and ultimate values. If you utilize a multitude of fuels with very different calorific, proximate and ultimate values, the fuels should be mixed before the boiler in order to have the best steady-state performance of the boiler.\n\n## Other Things to Consider\n\nHog fuel quality depends not only on the raw material characteristics but also on the way that hog fuel is handled. There are several inter-related things to consider when designing a hog fuel storage system, including:\n\n- Type of combustor\n- Types of material being stored\n- Amount of storage required\n- Pile size and shape\n- Pile compaction\n- Dry fibre loss due to microbial action\n- Fire prevention\n- Natural air drying\n- Climate\n- Need to keep fuel dry (or not)\n- Dust control\n- Tracking the amount of inventory\n- Pile building and reclaiming\n\n### Type of Combustor\n\nAs noted above, the fuel and the type of combustor must be compatible to achieve satisfactory boiler performance.\n\n### Types of Material Being Stored\n\n![Clean Wood Chips](/images/wood-chips-1.jpg)\n*Clean Wood Chips*\n\nRadically different types of material such as clean wood chips, short rotation coppice (SRC) and forest debris should not be stored in the same pile, as they decompose at different rates, which can lead to spontaneous combustion. They should be stored separately and blended just prior to transport to the boiler.\n\n![Wood Pellets](/images/wood-pellets22.jpg)\n*Wood Pellets*\n\nFuels such as pre-processed wood pellets require special handling. They are uniform in size and moisture content, are very free flowing, but are quite fragile, absorb water and easily degrade. And, the dust created when handling wood pellets is very explosive. Storage in silos is appropriate but care must be taken to accommodate the explosive nature of wood pellet dust.\n\n### Amount of Storage Required\n\nThe amount of storage required depends upon:\n\n- Minimum fuel storage; how much storage the plant's financiers, regulators, clients and/or insurers require as a minimum to ensure continuous operation\n- Known fuel delivery interruptions; the length of periods when fuel delivery can be anticipated to be interrupted, say for long weekends, or when supplier's mills are shutdown\n- Reliability of fuel delivery; there must be enough fuel on hand to cover likely transportation delays\n- Contingency supplies, to cover periods when forests are inaccessible for fire season, the wet season or during spring break-up.\n- Fibre supply contractual requirements; the ability to continue to stockpile fuel when the power plant is shut down for annual maintenance.\n\nOften the space available dictates the size and shape of the storage pile and the maximum amount of fuel that can be stored.\n\nTypically, biomass-fired power plants will stockpile a minimum of 20-30 days worth of fuel, but many will store 60-days worth or more.\n\n### Pile Size and Shape\n\nThe pile storage capacity is a function of the pile size (volume) and the bulk density of the fuel. The bulk density can vary depending upon the size of the particles in the pile, the moisture content and the amount of compaction.\n\nSelecting the correct pile shape is important. Large, high piles have a lower surface to mass ratio, lower heat dissipation rates and tend to heat-up more due to microbial action. Long, low piles have a greater surface to mass ratio, build-up less heat and dissipate heat better. Flat-topped piles absorb rain more readily than do sloped piles which tend to shed the rain. Piles with a lower surface to mass ratio take longer to absorb rain but also take longer to evaporate it.\n\nPile size has an effect on pile footprint and vice versa. High piles generally have a smaller footprint than do long, low piles of equal capacity. The pile base is usually costly to construct, particularly if paved; so from a cost perspective, a smaller footprint is better. Pile shape is also influenced by the type of reclaim technology selected.\n\n### Pile Compaction\n\n![Hog Fuel Dozer](/images/hog-dozer-5.jpg)\n*Hog Fuel Dozer*\n\nPile compaction varies depending upon the size and depth of the pile, the size of the particles in the pile, and the type of dozer driving over the pile, if any. The larger and deeper the pile, the greater will be the natural compaction. The density near the pile edges will be significantly less than near the middle. And, because of their smaller tire footprint, rubber-tired vehicles compact biomass more than do tracked vehicles.\n\nSmaller particles compact differently than do larger particles, so particle segregation within a pile will result in different densities. Particle size segregation naturally occurs as a pile is being built; larger particles tend to roll down the surface to the outer edges of the pile. Additionally, size segregation is greatly affected by wind, which will concentrate fine particles in one or more parts of the pile.\n\nSome compaction studies have shown that the density deep inside a large pile can increase by 25-30% higher than the surface density and the overall pile density can increase by 14-15%.\n\n### Dry Fibre Loss\n\nMicrobial biological action within a biomass pile results in fibre losses. Some studies show that more than 1% of useful fibre can be lost per month of storage due to biological action. Consequently, the plant must bring in more material to make up for this loss, which can involve substantial additional costs.\n\nBiological action is affected by the type and species of biomass being handled, moisture content, temperature, and the amount of oxygen present. With sufficient oxygen, microbial action will increase as the moisture content and temperature increase.\n\nSome studies show that the losses due to biological action are lower in highly compacted piles where the amount of oxygen is restricted.\n\nOther studies have shown that if air flow is enhanced, the heat can be dissipated and biological action slowed down, thereby reducing the amount of heat generated.\n\nOther studies have shown that microbial action is most active and resulting fibre losses the greatest, within the first week of storage. Consequently, some believe that when fresh hog fuel is being delivered, that hog fuel storage piles should be operated on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, so that new fibre is used immediately when it is first brought in ('hot' feed to the boiler), before microbial action can occur, thereby minimizing the dry fibre losses. However, when reclaiming from the long-term storage pile, reclaiming should be done on a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO) in order to use the oldest fuel first.\n\nDry fibre loss can be further minimized by the following practices:\n\n- For long-term biomass storage, store the material in as large particles as possible, with a minimum amount of small particles which can fill the voids and restrict air flow. This practice will necessitate re-processing the hog fuel into particle sizes acceptable to the boiler shortly before the fuel is conveyed to the boiler.\n- Do not compact the storage piles, thereby enhancing natural air flow through the pile and assisting heat dissipation and decreasing biological action.\n\nAs a side effect of dry fibre loss, the ash content rises when expressed as a percentage of the dry fibre left, as the amount of non-organic material in the fuel is not affected by microbial action. Therefore, the higher the dry fibre losses, the higher the ash content in the fuel delivered to the boiler.\n\n### Fire Prevention\n\nHeat can build-up within hog fuel storage piles to the point of spontaneous-combustion, which can result in huge inventory losses and potential damage to structures and equipment.\n\nFires will smoulder deep inside a pile for a long time. When a pile is opened up and exposed to oxygen, the fire will flare up into open flames. About the only way to extinguish a hog fuel pile fire is to open the pile, spread it out on the ground and extinguish it with lots of water. High, large volume piles on small footprints are harder to take apart than are low spread-out piles.\n\n![Dozer on Fire](/images/dmi-case-on-fire.jpg)\n*Dozer on Fire*\n\nMills and power plants with biomass storage piles have learned the hard way to minimize pile sizes in order to minimize the hazard and losses associated with fires in large piles and will often employ multiple piles separated by fire breaks.\n\nDust will build-up on any flat surface. Some of the worst fires are started as a combination of fine dust and hydraulic oil and snow packed around heat generating equipment.\n\nIf piles are dressed with mobile equipment, care must be taken to ensure fires are not started by dust building-up and igniting around hot exhaust systems.\n\nAll structures and equipment should be equipped with spark and fire detection and suppression equipment. In extreme cold climates, multiple zone, dry sprinkler systems should be used to minimize the wetted areas and consequent freezing when the system is tripped.\n\nWood pellet dust is highly explosive as well as being inflammable; so explosion detection and suppression systems must be used.\n\n### Natural Air-Drying\n\nNatural drying can occur as a result of the internal heat from microbial action and good airflow through the pile; more so than from the effect of climate. Building the pile to enhance natural air flow through the storage pile increases the drying effect.\n\nStudies have shown that it is possible to drop the moisture content of hog fuel from 45% MC to 30% by natural air flow means only; but depending upon the climate, it will require a time period of 30 – 60 days.\n\nCare must be taken not to mix forest residue, SRC and clean wood chips in one pile; the different rates of microbial action will cause uneven heating and drying.\n\nPile size and shape has an effect on natural drying. Piles with a large volume to surface area ratio generate more heat, have lower air flow through the pile and dissipate heat slower and therefore dry slower.\n\nConversely, outdoor piles with a high surface area to volume ratio have larger surface areas through which they can absorb more rainfall and therefore can be in an on-going wet-dry-wet cycle; this is a big factor in very wet climates.\n\nPiles subject to high rainfall can have an insulating wet layer between 1.0 – 3.0 m deep, which impedes air flow, increases the internal temperature and reduces heat dissipation leading to greater microbial action, more heat build-up and possibly spontaneous combustion. A snow cap on top of the pile can have the same effects.\n\nPiles containing a lot of fine material have higher rates of microbial action and heat build-up, absorb rain easier and have lower air flow rates and therefore dry slower, if at all.\n\nCompacted piles have lower air flows and dry slower.\n\n### The Need to Keep Fuel Dry (Or Not)\n\n![Hog Fuel Storage Building](/images/covered-hog-fuel-storage.jpg)\n*Hog Fuel Storage Building*\n\nThe advantages of keeping fuel dry are numerous and seem to make sense, but imply that the pile will be covered to protect it from the weather. However, the choice to keep fuel dry is not so simple, particularly if large volumes of material are involved. For example, a 30 MW biomass-fired power plant requires >600 BDt/d of fuel occupying 3,585 m³/d loose volume. Therefore, 20-days usage will require approximately 71,000 m³ of storage. This will be equivalent to a 21 m high longitudinal, conical pile with a footprint of 42 m x 90 m. To cover this would require an A-frame building 33 m high with a footprint of approximately 54 m x 115 m, including room for stacking and reclaiming equipment. A building this size is very costly.\n\n![Wood Pellet Silos](/images/wood-pellet-silos31.jpg)\n*Wood Pellet Silos*\n\nSome fuels, such as wood pellets, which absorb water easily, must be kept dry. Fortunately wood pellets have great flow characteristics and are very suitable for storage in silos.\n\nIn addition to keeping fuel dry, there are environmental and aesthetic reasons for covering your biomass fuel piles, including:\n\n- Minimizing fugitive dusting if in or near an environmental or residential sensitive area\n- Hiding the piles from view if in a town or city\n\n### Climate\n\nClimate has a big influence on biomass pile storage. Special measures are required for extreme climates with high rainfalls, large snowfalls, high winds, very hot or extremely cold temperatures. Some climates can also help to dry biomass, if the piles are constructed as described above.\n\n### Dust Control\n\nDry biomass can be very dusty. Fugitive dust will escape at every process or handling point if measures to contain it are not provided for. There are (4) main parts to good dust control:\n\n**1. Minimizing dust generation**\n\n- Store biomass in as large particles as possible, as long as possible\n\n![Dust Collector](/images/dust-collector.jpg)\n*Dust Collector*\n\n- Minimize drop heights of processed fuel\n- Minimize conveyor speeds\n- Use low speed shredders\n\n**2. Dust containment measures including:**\n\n- Enclosing all processing equipment and transfer points\n- Maintaining negative pressures inside enclosures and structures\n- Protecting conveyors from wind\n- Erecting wind fences to protect open piles from winds\n\n**3. Dust collection**\n\n- Connect negative pressure dust collection systems to all enclosures to minimize fugitive dusting and collect the airborne dust\n- Discharge the collected dust into sealed containers and dispose the dust appropriately\n- One thing that might be considered with covered storage buildings is drawing the boiler combustion air from the building to keep the storage building under a negative pressure and thereby minimize fugitive dusting. This also helps to minimize the problems of off-gassing and odour control, which are associated with biomass storage systems.\n\n**4. Clean-up Program**\n\n- No dust control system is perfect and dust will build-up if left in place long enough, so institute a clean-up program.\n- Utilize a vacuum system to clean-up spills and dust build-ups.\n- Do not use air to blow dust away as it will just spread the airborne dust, which can be quite explosive. Also, the blown dust will just settle out elsewhere.\n\n### Tracking the Amount of Biomass Inventory\n\nWhere any bulk, raw resource is used in an industrial process, there is a requirement to track both usage and inventory. And with the increased movement to utilizing biomass as a fuel source, more companies are discovering the difficulty in accurately measuring biomass inventory. This problem should be considered during the design of the pile building and reclaiming systems.\n\nAccurately determining the amount of fibre in biomass piles has long been problematic and even today with accurate measuring devices, fibre pile measurement doesn't have an easy solution. Pulp and paper mills everywhere have struggled with this problem for years. One year they will have to write-off costly wood chip inventory that appears to have disappeared; the next year they will have too much inventory. Other facilities that utilize biomass have similar inventory assessment problems.\n\nThe problems stem from the variability of the basic physical properties of biomass, including, different species, moisture content, different basic and bulk densities, varying amounts of compaction and dry fibre loss. Additionally, using multiple inventory tracking measures, including 'green' or bone dry tonnes (BDt), solid wood or bulk densities, and solid wood volumes or bulk volumes, lead to inventory errors when converting from one measure to another and back again.\n\nFollowing are some suggestions for accurately tracking inventory.\n\n- Ensure frequent pile turn-over, to minimize losses due to biological action or spontaneous combustion.\n- If space is available, use a multiple pile system where piles are routinely 'zeroed-out', or emptied completely; this way the inventory can be rationalized more frequently so that errors don't accumulate.\n- Do not rely on 'rule of thumb' conversion factors to convert between volume, wet weight and mass; and do not track biomass inventory on a volumetric (m³) or green weight (Gt) basis, as neither reflect the true amount of dry fibre present. Track the tonnage in BDt rather than in Gt or in m³.\n- Rely on accurate measuring of the flows into and out of the chip pile. Utilize multiple, redundant scales on both the infeed and outfeed from a pile, so that a malfunctioning scale can be quickly identified; and, recalibrate the scales at least twice per year, summer and winter.\n- Measure the ever-changing moisture content (MC) of both the incoming and outgoing biomass so that the true amount of dry fibre (BDt) can be accurately calculated from the Gt scale measurements.\n- Moisture content can be measured by on-line moisture sensors or by lab analysis of biomass samples from both incoming and outgoing flows.\n- The true amount of fibre remaining in a pile (BDt) at any one time would be the difference between the incoming and outgoing amounts.\n\n*Note: Tracking the amount of biomass inventory is covered in more detail in another article titled \"Chip / Biomass Pile Inventory Measurement\", which can be seen on my website.*\n\n### Pile Building and Reclaiming\n\n![Linear Under-Pile Reclaimer](/images/linear-under-pile-reclaimer2.jpg)\n*Linear Under-Pile Reclaimer*\n\nThere are many different methods and types of equipment for pile building and reclaiming. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Pile building and reclaiming systems range from the fully manual to fully automatic. Equipment choice should consider the type of fuel being handled, the fuel requirements of the boiler and the possible requirement for redundancy. This is a big topic, which I will write about in another article sometime in the future.\n\nIt is my experience that in order to minimize operating costs, inexperienced entrepreneurs embarking on biomass-fired power plant projects want to have fully automatic systems with 100% live-storage. If they are also planning on storing large volumes of fuel, 100% live-storage can be prohibitively costly.\n\nGenerally, once an order of magnitude capital cost has been prepared and the client sees what the capital cost is going to be, pile sizes are reduced and the requirement for 100% live-storage is dropped. So, it is a good idea to prepare a feasibility study before embarking on process definition or detail design.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nAs you can see from the foregoing, there are a lot of factors to consider when designing a biomass storage system. Almost assuredly, the factors that dominate the design at one facility will not apply at another similar plant. It is strongly recommended that you employ a biomass handling specialist with lots of experience to assist you in designing the most appropriate system for the material being handled that can be accommodated on the site and that will fit your budget.\n\nUsually if during the early design phases, proper consideration is given to the fuel quality, storage and reclaiming requirements, the resulting fuel handling system ends up being a technically simple process. However, all of the factors described in this document need to be considered when designing a biomass storage system.\n\nBecause of all of the physical variables of fuel types and sources and the possible combinations with the end uses to which the biomass is being put, and environmental, commercial and contractual items to be considered, it is not possible to make firm recommendations that cover all biomass storage installations. However, it is possible to make a few generalizations, including:\n\n- Ensure the moisture content of the fuel being delivered to the boiler is within the design limits for the boiler.\n- Store the biomass in as large particles as possible and do the final size reduction shortly before the biomass is conveyed to the boiler.\n- Remove as much of the contaminants as is technically or economically feasible.\n- Consider the fuel requirements of the combustor.\n- Store radically different materials separately and blend to obtain a uniform product after storage and prior to being conveyed to the boiler.\n- Don't store more than is necessary to efficiently operate the plant without causing downtime due to fuel shortages.\n- Determine the optimum pile size and shape for the specific biomass being handled that best meets the requirements of the process and fits the site.\n- Don't compact the piles by driving on them with mobile equipment.\n- Design the system to minimize dry fibre losses due to biological action or spontaneous combustion.\n- Provide for dust control, and spark, fire, and explosion detection and suppression systems as required.\n- If space allows, utilize multiple piles separated by fire breaks.\n- If you have wet fuel, design the storage system to take advantage of natural air-drying.\n- Institute an accurate fibre tracking system.\n- Determine whether FIFO or LIFO is appropriate for your process.\n- Select reclaiming equipment that is appropriate for the material being handled.\n\n## Glossary\n\n- **BDt**: bone dry tonnes\n- **CEN**: European Committee for Standardization\n- **d**: day\n- **FIFO**: first-in, first-out\n- **Gt**: green [wet] tonne\n- **LIFO**: last-in, first-out\n- **m**: meter\n- **m³**: cubic meter\n- **mm**: millimetre\n- **MC**: moisture content\n- **MW**: megawatt\n- **SRC**: short rotation coppice\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

Woody biomass, called ‘hog fuel’, has long been utilized as a fuel in cogeneration plants at pulp and paper mills, where it was traditionally a waste product from the processing of clean white wood chips used to make pulp. While many practical lessons have been learned about what is appropriate for hog fuel storage, generally little documented study has been directed at storage practices, primarily due to its abundance and historical status as a waste product with next to zero value.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, hog fuel is the basic feedstock for biomass-fired power plants and is becoming a hot commodity and it is the single biggest on-going cost item for energy plants. How it is handled has an effect on quality, so a greater understanding of hog fuel storage requirements is required.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/biomass-pile.jpg\" alt=\"Bark Pile\">\n\u003Cem>Bark Pile\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Biomass is not an easy material to handle. It appears in a myriad of species, forms and sizes; it knits together, doesn’t flow well, consolidates and packs easily; it can have a wide range of moisture contents, basic and bulk densities and calorific values. It will freeze; it is very dusty, catches fire easily and is self-combustible; it can contain all manner of contaminants.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What makes good hog fuel? When ‘greenfield’ plants are designed, boiler technology is usually selected based on the type of fuel available. When existing boilers are converted to burn biomass in ‘brownfield’ projects, the fuel must be matched to the existing boiler in order to minimize required boiler modifications. While individual fuel characteristics can vary considerably, there are four main fuel quality parameters that must be met to ensure good boiler operation, including maintaining:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Consistent moisture content\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Consistent particle size\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Minimal contamination in order to minimize ash content\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Consistent calorific, proximate and ultimate values\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"1-moisture-content-of-fuel\">1. Moisture Content of Fuel\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Generally the dryer the fuel, the less energy is required to evaporate the remaining water and the more energy is available for generating heat or power. The amount of moisture contained in the incoming fuel has a great effect on the efficiency of the combustor, which is designed to operate best with a fuel that is maintained within a particular moisture band. Move outside that band and the boiler and/or its emissions control system is likely to have operating problems. For example, a boiler designed for fuel at 25% MC might have a burner efficiency approaching 80%; and if presented with fuel at 50% MC the burner efficiency could drop as low as 65%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/rotary-dryer-graphic1.jpg\" alt=\"Rotary Bark Dryer\">\n\u003Cem>Rotary Bark Dryer\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most important requirement is that the moisture content is maintained as close to the ideal level for the particular boiler. Too dry fuel can cause as many operating problems as fuel that is too wet.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If your fuel is inherently wet, either the boiler must be designed to accommodate the wet fuel or the fuel must be dried prior to the boiler. In both cases, energy is required to drive-off the moisture, and finding the least costly way to do so can be a challenge. Drum dryers have been used to dry fuel before combustion, but in most cases that has proven uneconomical.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bubbling fluidized bed boilers handle wet fuel the best, as the wet fuel is instantly dried in the sand bed just prior to combustion. All non-natural methods of drying the fuel require costly energy.

Suspension burning requires the fuel to be dried and ground-up or pulverized to a very small size so that it can be blown into the boiler. Most fluidized-bed boilers generally require their fuel to be ground-up to a particle size &#x3C;63mm (&#x3C;2 ½”); (see CEN P63 specification). Pin-hole grates or vibrating grates tolerate material &#x3C;100mm (&#x3C;4”); (see CEN P100 specification). Both P63 and P100 specifications call for specific size distributions with minimum allowable amounts of acceptable sized material and specific limits of the amounts of both undersize and oversize material. For the best combustor and emissions control operation, the hog fuel particle size being fed to the combustor should be kept within those limits.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Particle size within a biomass pile also has a big effect on moisture absorption, heat build-up, heat dissipation and dry fibre losses.

The bulk density can vary depending upon the size of the particles in the pile, the moisture content and the amount of compaction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Selecting the correct pile shape is important. Large, high piles have a lower surface to mass ratio, lower heat dissipation rates and tend to heat-up more due to microbial action. Long, low piles have a greater surface to mass ratio, build-up less heat and dissipate heat better. Flat-topped piles absorb rain more readily than do sloped piles which tend to shed the rain. Piles with a lower surface to mass ratio take longer to absorb rain but also take longer to evaporate it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pile size has an effect on pile footprint and vice versa. High piles generally have a smaller footprint than do long, low piles of equal capacity. The pile base is usually costly to construct, particularly if paved; so from a cost perspective, a smaller footprint is better.

The larger and deeper the pile, the greater will be the natural compaction. The density near the pile edges will be significantly less than near the middle. And, because of their smaller tire footprint, rubber-tired vehicles compact biomass more than do tracked vehicles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Smaller particles compact differently than do larger particles, so particle segregation within a pile will result in different densities. Particle size segregation naturally occurs as a pile is being built; larger particles tend to roll down the surface to the outer edges of the pile. Additionally, size segregation is greatly affected by wind, which will concentrate fine particles in one or more parts of the pile.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some compaction studies have shown that the density deep inside a large pile can increase by 25-30% higher than the surface density and the overall pile density can increase by 14-15%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"dry-fibre-loss\">Dry Fibre Loss\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Microbial biological action within a biomass pile results in fibre losses. Some studies show that more than 1% of useful fibre can be lost per month of storage due to biological action. Consequently, the plant must bring in more material to make up for this loss, which can involve substantial additional costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Biological action is affected by the type and species of biomass being handled, moisture content, temperature, and the amount of oxygen present. With sufficient oxygen, microbial action will increase as the moisture content and temperature increase.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some studies show that the losses due to biological action are lower in highly compacted piles where the amount of oxygen is restricted.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Other studies have shown that if air flow is enhanced, the heat can be dissipated and biological action slowed down, thereby reducing the amount of heat generated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Other studies have shown that microbial action is most active and resulting fibre losses the greatest, within the first week of storage. Consequently, some believe that when fresh hog fuel is being delivered, that hog fuel storage piles should be operated on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, so that new fibre is used immediately when it is first brought in (‘hot’ feed to the boiler), before microbial action can occur, thereby minimizing the dry fibre losses. However, when reclaiming from the long-term storage pile, reclaiming should be done on a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO) in order to use the oldest fuel first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dry fibre loss can be further minimized by the following practices:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>For long-term biomass storage, store the material in as large particles as possible, with a minimum amount of small particles which can fill the voids and restrict air flow. This practice will necessitate re-processing the hog fuel into particle sizes acceptable to the boiler shortly before the fuel is conveyed to the boiler.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Do not compact the storage piles, thereby enhancing natural air flow through the pile and assisting heat dissipation and decreasing biological action.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>As a side effect of dry fibre loss, the ash content rises when expressed as a percentage of the dry fibre left, as the amount of non-organic material in the fuel is not affected by microbial action.

When a pile is opened up and exposed to oxygen, the fire will flare up into open flames. About the only way to extinguish a hog fuel pile fire is to open the pile, spread it out on the ground and extinguish it with lots of water.

This article concerns biomass delivery by truck and the systems available for unloading the trucks.\n\nResidual chips, shavings, and sawdust from sawmills are delivered primarily by truck to pulpmills, pellet plants, and panelboard plants. Woodwaste (hog fuel) from sawmills and other raw log processors is delivered by truck to biomass-fired energy systems and cogeneration plants. Wood pellets are delivered by truck and by railcar and are loaded onto ships or delivered direct to biomass-fired power plants.\n\n## Delivery by Truck\n\nThere are many different types and sizes of trucks used depending upon the material being handled, the weather conditions, the unloading facilities available, distances traveled, the types of truck available, road conditions, the most economical transport method, road weight allowances, required throughput capacity, etc. There are generally two types of trucks used: self unloading and non-self unloading trucks.\n\n### Self-unloading Trucks\n\nSelf-unloading trailers are available in the following configurations:\n\n- End-tipping trailer boxes or conventional end-dump trucks in many sizes.\n- Live-bottom 'shuffle-floors' in 53' (16.2m) trailers.\n- Live-bottom, chain or belt conveyors in 40' – 53' (12.2m – 16.2m) semi trailers.\n- Roll-on, Roll-off boxes.\n- Side-tipping trailer boxes; some in B-train trailers.\n\nSelf-unloading trucks and trailers can dump their loads onto a paved pad or directly into a receiving hopper. Live-bottom trailers take 15-20 minutes to discharge their loads.\n\nWood pellets are free-flowing but are delicate and must be protected from weather. In addition to the trailers described above, wood pellets can be delivered readily in bottom discharge trailers (belly dumps) or in trailer boxes with live-bottom screw conveyors. Belly dump trailers discharge into in-ground hoppers, which are subject to contamination from the truck driving over, particularly in cold climates where snow, ice, sand and rocks stick to the underside of the trucks.\n\nSome companies utilize self-unloading trucks with pneumatic conveyors for unloading wood pellets; however, this method is slow and is not recommended as product degradation is quite high.\n\n### Non-self Unloading Trucks\n\nIn Canada, wood chips for pulpmills are typically delivered in 8-axle, Super B-train trucks with 'lead' and 'pup' trailers with 'possum-bellies' delivering up to 6,000 ft³ (170m³) of payload. Depending upon the jurisdiction, these trucks can be 90' (27.4m) long and longer. In British Columbia (BC) and Alberta (AB), large capacity extended Super B-train trucks are being used to transport light chips made from Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) killed wood. These very large trucks are more economical to operate particularly on long haul distances >150 km.\n\nConventional chip trailers are emptied through their end-doors on end-tippers / dumpers. On smaller dumpers, the trailers have to be disconnected from the truck and emptied separately, but on the largest dumpers these trailers can be emptied without decoupling. As the truck and trailers are tipped, the pup trailer empties first, then the chips from the lead trailer slide through the pup trailer into the receiving hopper.\n\nWood chips, shavings, sawdust and pellets are often delivered in semi-trailers designed for the service transporting up to 3,400 ft³ (96m³). These can be self-unloading or can be emptied on an end-tipper.\n\nTrucks that are emptied on an end or side-tipper must have the engines and tanks properly configured to prevent leaking or flooding at extreme tilt angles.\n\n## Truck Dumpers\n\nTruck dumpers come in many sizes and configurations. There are two basic types: end tippers and side tippers.\n\n### End Tippers\n\nEnd tippers are the most common truck dumper and have a platform that lifts the front of the truck or trailer so that the material slides out of the back of the truck or trailer. Common features on an end-tipper include: a dumper deck with hydraulic lift cylinders, pivot bearings at the discharge end, a backstop, safety hold-down hoops, vibrators, a hydraulic power unit, hydraulic piping and a live-bottom receiving hopper.\n\n#### Dumper Decks\n\nDumper decks can be as short as 45' (13.7m) long for short trucks and trailers and up to 90' (27.4m) long for extended Super B-Train truck / trailer combinations. Truck-trailer combinations longer than the dumper deck can be handled at mills with short dumpers, but it means that each trailer must be decoupled from the train and dumped separately, greatly increasing the truck turn-around time.\n\nThe hydraulic tipping cylinders lift the deck and truck to a maximum of 65° from horizontal. The deck should be designed to resist permanent deformation should one dump cylinder fail while the deck is in the up position with a fully loaded truck.\n\nThe dumper deck is equipped with a backstop against which the back-end of the trailer butts up against to prevent it from sliding off the back of the dumper, and also with safety hold-down hoops to keep the truck trailer from lifting up off the dumper when in the raised position.\n\n#### Hydraulic Components\n\nThe main hydraulic lift cylinders are large, multi-stage cylinders, up to 19\" (483mm) diameter and up to 600\" (15.2m) stroke. Multi-stage cylinders can be mounted with the cylinder rod down or up, but mounting the rod down prevents dirt and contaminants from accumulating on the top of the rod segments thereby minimizing rod and barrel wear.\n\nDumpers require large hydraulic systems to operate the main lift cylinders quickly, and if installed, a backstop cylinder, vibrator[s], bridge cylinders and receiving live-bottom hopper hydraulic drive motor. The hydraulic system should have the following components: large tank with flooded-suction pumps, manifold mounted valves, filters on pressure and return lines, proportional valves for controlling the speed of the main cylinders as they extend, retract and pass through the multi-stage cylinder transition zones.\n\nThe hydraulic piping system should utilize heavy wall piping with SAE 4-bolt flanges designed for the service. Piping can be carbon or stainless steel but should be pickled and passivated. In cold climates, the piping should be insulated and have valving installed to permit warm oil to recirculate to all the components when the dumper is not in use, thereby keeping the components warm and ready for use.\n\nThe hydraulic system should be equipped with a safety circuit that prevents the deck from automatically dropping should one cylinder or the hydraulic lift circuit fail.\n\n### Back-on and Drive-through End Tippers\n\nThere are two main types of end-tipper; back-on and drive-through. As the 'back-on' name implies, the truck / trailer backs onto the dumper deck from the non-pivot end and drives forward off the same end of the deck. In a drive-through dumper, the truck drives onto the deck from the pivot end and exits from the other. The big differences between the two types of dumpers are the increased complexity and the higher truck through-put rate on the drive-through dumper.\n\nThe drive-through dumper has a drive-over bridge that permits the truck to drive over the receiving hopper and onto the dumper deck. The drive-over bridge is equipped with hydraulic cylinders to lift it up out of the way, exposing the receiving hopper before the dumper deck is lifted and the chips start to fall out of the trailers.\n\nOn a back-on dumper, the deck backstop is permanently fixed in the up position. On drive-through dumpers, the backstops can be either retracted into the deck or pivoted up to one side to permit the entering truck to pass by. In cold climates, the backstop is equipped with one or more hydraulic or electric vibrators, which are used to shake the truck trailer once it is in the up position, in order to loosen chips which might be frozen to the bottom or sides of the trailers.\n\n### At-Grade and Above-Grade Dumpers\n\nDumper decks can be located at-grade or elevated above grade. Dumpers located at grade require a deep below-grade pit >30' deep (9.1m) to house the large receiving hopper, which is usually sized to hold 1.5 truckloads of material. Elevating the material out of a deep pit requires a long belt conveyor. Below-grade pits can often be a problem in areas with high water-tables.\n\nDrive-through dumpers are often located 10' – 20' (3m-6m) above grade, the intent being to minimize the depth of the below-grade receiving pit. Above-grade, drive-through dumpers require long ramps at each end of the dumper, gently sloped for the trucks to drive on and off the dumper; this can result in a very large footprint for the drive-through dumper system. For example, a 10' (3m) high ramp at 5% slope is 200' (60m) long. So, the total footprint size for an above-ground dumper installation including ramps and truck turning circle can be between 60'-80' wide by 500'-600' long (18m-24m by 152m-183m).\n\nBack-on dumpers are available in an extended-arm configuration that permits the receiving hopper to be mounted above-grade or slightly below grade. Extended arm dumpers lift the truck above the above-grade hopper, so are limited to 80' (24.3m) long decks.\n\n### Cycle Times and Throughput Rates\n\nRecommended cycle times for end-tippers are, deck up – 1 minute and 55 seconds, and deck down – 1 minute and 30 seconds.\n\nDumper throughput rates depend upon: the truck staging time, the dumper cycle time, the receiving hopper run-out time, and the truck exit time. Typical throughput rates for drive-through dumpers are 5 trucks per hour average and 6 trucks per hour maximum.\n\nFast cycle rates are important to reduce the time the trucks are on the millsite, thereby reducing demurrage charges. Some large pulp and paper mills have multiple dumpers processing up to 250 Super B-train trucks per day, so demurrage charges can be significant if trucks are delayed.\n\nTypical throughput rates for back-on dumpers are quite a bit less, 3-4 trucks per hour average on the large dumpers. However, if the deck is too short to handle coupled dual trailers, then each trailer must be uncoupled and dumped separately, which greatly increases the truck cycle time to a maximum of 3 trailers per hour.\n\n## Dumper Structures\n\nDumpers require heavy foundations to resist the truck and chip dead loads, the shifting pivot loads, the shifting hydraulic cylinder loads, the wind loads and the dynamic loads from chip payloads falling 60' (18.3m) from a truck into a receiving hopper. The concrete pits required to hold a receiving hopper are deep and large. The tunnel required for the belt conveyor from the receiving hopper is large and long.\n\nAs noted, above-grade dumpers need long in and out ramps. And, unless the dumper is situated in an open field, retaining walls are often required to keep the ramps from impinging on adjacent buildings or structures.\n\nControl booths are required. A control booth, with typical dimensions of 6' x 8' x 8' (1.8 x 1.8 x 2.4m), should be equipped with large windows, anti-slip flooring, HVAC, control panel, good lighting, intercom with the mill control room and a card reader.\n\nThe dumper hydraulic power unit (HPU) should be located inside an enclosure to protect it from the weather, particularly in cold climates. The enclosure should have filtered make-up air to prevent wood dust from accumulating on the HPU.\n\n## Control Devices\n\nBack-on dumpers should be equipped with the following minimum control devices:\n\n- Deck upper and lower limit switches.\n- Deck position indication (Temposonic cylinder), to control deck speed at the cylinder transition points.\n- Truck location photocells.\n- Wind-speed sensor.\n\nDrive-through dumpers have the additional control devices:\n\n- Bridge upper and lower limit switches.\n- Backstop upper and lower limit switches.\n- Backstop safety pin position switch.\n\nAs a minimum, the hydraulic power unit (HPU) should have:\n\n- High and low oil pressure switches.\n- Oil temperature sensors and switches.\n- High and low oil level switches.\n- Air/oil cooler and oil heater.\n\n## Description of Typical Dumper Operation\n\nTrucks enter the millsite and typically drive onto a truck weighscale where the trucks are weighed and other pertinent information is recorded, including: trucking company, truck #, source and type of product, species, weight, etc. This information is often recorded on printed bar code cards. After weighing-in, the truck drives off the weighscale and drives to the truck staging area located before the truck dumper.\n\nA set of traffic lights is often used to control the truck traffic to the dumper. When the dumper is available, the traffic light turns to green to signal that the next truck can drive onto the dumper.\n\n### Drive-Through Dumper Operation\n\nFollowing is a description of a typical dumping sequence for a drive-through dumper. Most dumpers are operated by the truck driver. When the traffic light turns green, the driver drives the truck over the drive-over bridge and onto the dumper deck. As the truck enters the dumper, a photocell turns the traffic light to red.\n\nAt a local control station, the driver operates controls to position the backstop, before backing the truck up against the backstop. The driver then engages the truck brakes, dumps the air from the air suspension system and stops the truck engine. After leaving the truck cab, the driver opens the trailer doors, engages a safety pin in the backstop and places a collecting bucket under the chip sample spout, if he is required to take a sample. He then enters the control booth where he scans his truck information card in a card-reader before starting the dump sequence.\n\nThe operating system's programmable logic controller (PLC) should be programmed such that the dumping sequence cannot be started until the truck information has been scanned, the receiving hopper is empty of the previous truck load and the backstop pin is engaged. Upon receiving approval from the PLC to start the dump sequence, the driver presses and holds a 'Dump' button, and the drive-over bridge rises up.\n\nOnce the bridge is up, the dumper deck will start to rise up. The driver must hold the dump button continuously or the dumping sequence will stop and the bridge and deck will hold in position. The purpose for this is to ensure the driver is safely inside the control booth whenever the dumper is in operation.\n\nAs the deck rises, the material load in the pup trailer pushes the back doors open (at ~35° – 40° deck slope) and the chips start to slide out of the trailer and into the receiving hopper. When the pup trailer is empty, the material load in the lead trailer pushes against and opens the lift panel on the front of the pup trailer and the chips slide out of the lead trailer and through the pup trailer and into the receiving hopper. Total trailer emptying time is approximately 1 minute.\n\nChip samples should be taken by an automatic chip sampler while the truck is dumping and the live-bottom hopper is metering the chips into the conveyor system.\n\nWhen the dumper deck is all the way up, the driver will be able to operate the backstop vibrators to loosen frozen chips, if required. The PLC should be programmed to control the timing and limit the amount the vibrators can be used. The PLC must also be programmed to not allow the operator to rapidly jog the dumper 'up' and 'down' in an effort to shake loose stuck chips, as this can cause the truck to bounce on the inclined deck and possibly jump over the backstop and fall into the receiving hopper.\n\nWhen the trailers are empty, the driver releases the Dump button and presses a 'Down' button and the dumper deck will start to lower back down onto its supports. When the dumper deck is all the way down, the drive-over bridge will lower back into place. If the driver releases the Down button the deck and bridge will stop and hold in position.\n\nWhen the deck and bridge are back down on their stops, the driver leaves the control booth, removes the backstop safety pin, transfers his chip sample from the collection bucket into a sample bag and attaches his truck information. He then enters his truck, starts the engine, engages the air suspension, releases the brakes, drives forward off the dumper deck, stops and closes his trailer doors. As the trailer pulls off the dumper deck, a photocell automatically moves the backstop out of the way ready for the next truck and turns the traffic light to green.\n\nThe driver of the empty truck drives back to the truck scales, weighs out and leaves the site. Some dumper decks have an integral truck scale built into the dumper deck, which helps to reduce the truck turn-around times.\n\n### Back-On Dumper Operation\n\nThe sequence is much the same as for a drive-through dumper with the following exceptions:\n\n- There is no drive-over bridge so the trucks are backed onto the dumper and driven off from the same end.\n- The backstop is fixed in place, so the driver doesn't have to be concerned with the backstop operation.\n\n## Portable and Transportable Trailer Dumpers\n\nPortable and transportable trailer dumpers with short decks are available and are generally used in temporary circumstances for dumping small trucks or separated trailers. Portable dumpers are equipped with truck axles and wheels and can be towed from location to location. Transportable dumpers are hauled to location on flat-bed trucks.\n\nThe dumpers are equipped with outriggers on each side to minimize the risk of the dumper toppling sideways.\n\nPortable / transportable dumpers are often located on top of an earthen ramp contained by a retaining wall, over which they dump the trailer loads onto a paved pad. A front-end loader then pushes the chips away before a second trailer can be emptied. A strong concrete pad is recommended for sitting the portable / transportable dumper on. With all the decoupling and recoupling required, the maximum throughput rate for a portable / transportable dumper is 3 trailers per hour.\n\n## Side Tippers\n\nThe quality of residual wastewood (hog fuel) can vary considerably from loose sawdust to dry, curled bark, to green, ropy bark, and often is very difficult to handle. Material transport over long distances is most economical if large capacity Super B-Train truck / trailer combinations are used but these trailers loaded with hog fuel are difficult to handle on a conventional end-tipper.\n\nSide-tipping dumpers have a platform that tips the trucks to one side. Side-tippers are not common; the author knows of only one in existence that is used for emptying trailers filled with processed hog fuel in an extreme northern climate. This hog fuel dumper (HFTD) was developed because hog fuel tends to be wetter than wood chips and freezes inside conventional trailers on long haul distances and is difficult to empty out of conventional end-discharge chip / biomass trailers, particularly coupled B-Trains. In cold weather on a conventional end-tipper, it is necessary to decouple the trailers and empty them separately, which is a time consuming and not always effective practice. Once biomass has frozen inside a trailer, the only solutions are to accept the payload loss or park the trailer indoors and let it thaw out.\n\nSide-tipping dumpers require special trailers that have one side that opens. The open area is 4-5 times as great as that on a conventional end-discharge trailer. When the trailers are tipped to the side, the hog fuel mass is not restrained and falls quite easily out of the large open area.\n\nSide-tippers have the following features and accessories:\n\n- Drive-through style.\n- Deck long enough so that decoupling is not required.\n- Deck tips to one side by hydraulic cylinders.\n- Truck hold-down chains are required because the load passes the center of gravity (CG) when tipped.\n- A hydraulic power unit (HPU).\n- A very long, above-grade receiving hopper, to match the overall trailer discharge length.\n- Approach and exit ramps.\n\nMaximum throughput on a side-tipper is approximately 4 Super B-Trains per hour depending upon the ability of the downstream conveying equipment to handle the variable quality of the hog fuel.\n\n### Side-tipping, Self-unloading Trailer Boxes\n\nSide-tipping, self-unloading trailers deserve to be discussed in more detail here. These trailers have been used successfully for hauling processed wastewood (hog fuel) in northern British Columbia (BC), Canada, which experiences very cold winters where hog fuel tends to freeze inside the trailer boxes on long hauls. These side-tipping trailer boxes have sides that open full-length, similar to those side-opening trailers used on the side-tipping dumper platform, with one significant difference; they don't need a trailer tipper / dumper to empty. Rather than tipping the entire trailer, the boxes tip sideways on an integral heavy steel trailer frame.\n\nAs with the side-tipping dumper platform, the side-tipping trailers go past the center of gravity when tipping. In order to prevent the trailer from capsizing sideways, it is necessary to drive the entire coupled truck / trailer unit slowly in a tight arc as first one then the other trailer is tipped and emptied. In this manner, the truck / trailer arc prevents the over-center trailer from capsizing. Unfortunately, this dumping method spreads the material over a considerable area, which must then be cleaned-up by a front-end loader.\n\nIf dumping into a receiving hopper, the stationary, side-tipping trailers must be chained-down before tipping the trailer boxes.\n\nOne of the big disadvantages of the side-tipping trailers is that the heavy steel trailer frame reduces the allowable payload significantly, which is a concern over long haul distances.\n\n## Safety\n\nIn addition to the common safety procedures in place in all wood processing plants, there are a few practices that are particular to the operation of a biomass truck dumper.\n\n- No one should be on or under the dumper deck or bridge when the dumper is in operation.\n- Do not operate the dumper above the manufacturer's recommended wind speed, usually 40 mph (64kph).\n- Clean snow and debris off the dumper deck before operating.\n- Do not rapidly jog the dumper deck 'up' and 'down' in an attempt to shake loose stuck chips.\n- Do not overfill the receiving hopper.\n- Ensure that stationary side-tipping trucks are properly restrained by chain 'hold-downs' to prevent them from capsizing when the load goes over-center.\n\n## Receiving Hoppers and Outstocking System\n\nLive-bottom receiving hoppers are most commonly multi-strand, drag-chain conveyors, but 'shuffle-floor' (walking-floor) hoppers are sometimes used. The receiving hopper should be large enough to contain approximately 1 ½ truckloads. If the outstocking system is properly designed, the receiving hopper should be empty and ready to receive the next truckload by the time the next full truck is on the dumper deck and ready to dump. The live-bottom hopper should have a fixed discharge opening and a variable speed drive for accurately metering the chips onto the outstocking conveyor.\n\nBelt conveyors are most commonly used to convey the chips from the receiving hopper to the storage area, but must be properly designed for the operating conditions. The minimum recommended belt size for a large truck dumper is 48\" wide (1219mm) operating at 450 fpm (2.29mps). The belt conveyor should be equipped with a belt weighscale for measuring the material throughput. It is recommended that a self-cleaning magnet be installed over the conveyor discharge pulley for removing tramp ferrous metal.\n\nThe belt conveyor should discharge onto a scalping screen, the intent being to remove any large pieces of material such as frozen lumps that could jam-up or damage downstream equipment.\n\n## Chip Sampling\n\nMost pulp and paper mills require that chips be sampled for quality reasons when delivered to the mill site. The obvious place to take chip samples is at the dumper when the trucks are being emptied. However, taking grab samples from the chip trailer is notoriously inaccurate and produces misleading conclusions regarding chip quality. It is imperative that a properly designed chip sampling device be installed and operated to give a true, representative sample of the material being delivered.\n\n## Dust Control\n\n6,000 ft³ (170m³) of biomass suddenly sliding 60' (18.3m) into a receiving hopper generates a considerable amount of dust. Few dumper installations try to control this dust, but it is an issue that is starting to receive attention from both health and environmental perspectives. It is possible to install an enclosure over the dumper pit and bridge, but it would require a fast-acting door on the drive-in side and a massive dust collector to keep the enclosure under a negative pressure to prevent fugitive dusting. The dust collector should also be connected to downstream conveyor transfer points.\n\nSome installations have tried 'fogging' systems which lay down a blanket of fog to which dust particles attach to water particles. These are finicky systems and may work in warm climates, but are not appropriate for cold climates.\n\n## Chip Contamination by Dirt, Sand, Rocks, Snow and Ice\n\nThe outside and underside of the chip trucks can become contaminated by dirt, sand, rocks, snow and ice, as they travel along the roads and highways to the millsite. The contaminants often fall from the truck during the dumping process and end up being discharged into the wood chip furnish to the pulp mill. One study conducted showed an average of 200 kg (440 lbs) of snow, ice, dirt, sand and rocks falling off every chip truck at the truck dumper. The sand and rocks can cause considerable damage to downstream equipment in the pulpmill and biomass boiler, and should be prevented from entering the chip flow to the mill.\n\n## Dumper Vendors\n\nThere are many companies that manufacture end-tippers.

This article concerns biomass delivery by truck and the systems available for unloading the trucks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Residual chips, shavings, and sawdust from sawmills are delivered primarily by truck to pulpmills, pellet plants, and panelboard plants. Woodwaste (hog fuel) from sawmills and other raw log processors is delivered by truck to biomass-fired energy systems and cogeneration plants. Wood pellets are delivered by truck and by railcar and are loaded onto ships or delivered direct to biomass-fired power plants.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"delivery-by-truck\">Delivery by Truck\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are many different types and sizes of trucks used depending upon the material being handled, the weather conditions, the unloading facilities available, distances traveled, the types of truck available, road conditions, the most economical transport method, road weight allowances, required throughput capacity, etc. There are generally two types of trucks used: self unloading and non-self unloading trucks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"self-unloading-trucks\">Self-unloading Trucks\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Self-unloading trailers are available in the following configurations:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>End-tipping trailer boxes or conventional end-dump trucks in many sizes.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Live-bottom ‘shuffle-floors’ in 53’ (16.2m) trailers.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Live-bottom, chain or belt conveyors in 40’ – 53’ (12.2m – 16.2m) semi trailers.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Roll-on, Roll-off boxes.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Side-tipping trailer boxes; some in B-train trailers.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Self-unloading trucks and trailers can dump their loads onto a paved pad or directly into a receiving hopper. Live-bottom trailers take 15-20 minutes to discharge their loads.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wood pellets are free-flowing but are delicate and must be protected from weather. In addition to the trailers described above, wood pellets can be delivered readily in bottom discharge trailers (belly dumps) or in trailer boxes with live-bottom screw conveyors. Belly dump trailers discharge into in-ground hoppers, which are subject to contamination from the truck driving over, particularly in cold climates where snow, ice, sand and rocks stick to the underside of the trucks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some companies utilize self-unloading trucks with pneumatic conveyors for unloading wood pellets; however, this method is slow and is not recommended as product degradation is quite high.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"non-self-unloading-trucks\">Non-self Unloading Trucks\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In Canada, wood chips for pulpmills are typically delivered in 8-axle, Super B-train trucks with ‘lead’ and ‘pup’ trailers with ‘possum-bellies’ delivering up to 6,000 ft³ (170m³) of payload. Depending upon the jurisdiction, these trucks can be 90’ (27.4m) long and longer. In British Columbia (BC) and Alberta (AB), large capacity extended Super B-train trucks are being used to transport light chips made from Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB) killed wood. These very large trucks are more economical to operate particularly on long haul distances >150 km.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Conventional chip trailers are emptied through their end-doors on end-tippers / dumpers. On smaller dumpers, the trailers have to be disconnected from the truck and emptied separately, but on the largest dumpers these trailers can be emptied without decoupling. As the truck and trailers are tipped, the pup trailer empties first, then the chips from the lead trailer slide through the pup trailer into the receiving hopper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wood chips, shavings, sawdust and pellets are often delivered in semi-trailers designed for the service transporting up to 3,400 ft³ (96m³). These can be self-unloading or can be emptied on an end-tipper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Trucks that are emptied on an end or side-tipper must have the engines and tanks properly configured to prevent leaking or flooding at extreme tilt angles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"truck-dumpers\">Truck Dumpers\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Truck dumpers come in many sizes and configurations. There are two basic types: end tippers and side tippers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"end-tippers\">End Tippers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>End tippers are the most common truck dumper and have a platform that lifts the front of the truck or trailer so that the material slides out of the back of the truck or trailer. Common features on an end-tipper include: a dumper deck with hydraulic lift cylinders, pivot bearings at the discharge end, a backstop, safety hold-down hoops, vibrators, a hydraulic power unit, hydraulic piping and a live-bottom receiving hopper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"dumper-decks\">Dumper Decks\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Dumper decks can be as short as 45’ (13.7m) long for short trucks and trailers and up to 90’ (27.4m) long for extended Super B-Train truck / trailer combinations. Truck-trailer combinations longer than the dumper deck can be handled at mills with short dumpers, but it means that each trailer must be decoupled from the train and dumped separately, greatly increasing the truck turn-around time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The hydraulic tipping cylinders lift the deck and truck to a maximum of 65° from horizontal. The deck should be designed to resist permanent deformation should one dump cylinder fail while the deck is in the up position with a fully loaded truck.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The dumper deck is equipped with a backstop against which the back-end of the trailer butts up against to prevent it from sliding off the back of the dumper, and also with safety hold-down hoops to keep the truck trailer from lifting up off the dumper when in the raised position.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"hydraulic-components\">Hydraulic Components\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>The main hydraulic lift cylinders are large, multi-stage cylinders, up to 19” (483mm) diameter and up to 600” (15.2m) stroke. Multi-stage cylinders can be mounted with the cylinder rod down or up, but mounting the rod down prevents dirt and contaminants from accumulating on the top of the rod segments thereby minimizing rod and barrel wear.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dumpers require large hydraulic systems to operate the main lift cylinders quickly, and if installed, a backstop cylinder, vibrator[s], bridge cylinders and receiving live-bottom hopper hydraulic drive motor. The hydraulic system should have the following components: large tank with flooded-suction pumps, manifold mounted valves, filters on pressure and return lines, proportional valves for controlling the speed of the main cylinders as they extend, retract and pass through the multi-stage cylinder transition zones.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The hydraulic piping system should utilize heavy wall piping with SAE 4-bolt flanges designed for the service. Piping can be carbon or stainless steel but should be pickled and passivated. In cold climates, the piping should be insulated and have valving installed to permit warm oil to recirculate to all the components when the dumper is not in use, thereby keeping the components warm and ready for use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The hydraulic system should be equipped with a safety circuit that prevents the deck from automatically dropping should one cylinder or the hydraulic lift circuit fail.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"back-on-and-drive-through-end-tippers\">Back-on and Drive-through End Tippers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>There are two main types of end-tipper; back-on and drive-through. As the ‘back-on’ name implies, the truck / trailer backs onto the dumper deck from the non-pivot end and drives forward off the same end of the deck. In a drive-through dumper, the truck drives onto the deck from the pivot end and exits from the other. The big differences between the two types of dumpers are the increased complexity and the higher truck through-put rate on the drive-through dumper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The drive-through dumper has a drive-over bridge that permits the truck to drive over the receiving hopper and onto the dumper deck. The drive-over bridge is equipped with hydraulic cylinders to lift it up out of the way, exposing the receiving hopper before the dumper deck is lifted and the chips start to fall out of the trailers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On a back-on dumper, the deck backstop is permanently fixed in the up position. On drive-through dumpers, the backstops can be either retracted into the deck or pivoted up to one side to permit the entering truck to pass by. In cold climates, the backstop is equipped with one or more hydraulic or electric vibrators, which are used to shake the truck trailer once it is in the up position, in order to loosen chips which might be frozen to the bottom or sides of the trailers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"at-grade-and-above-grade-dumpers\">At-Grade and Above-Grade Dumpers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Dumper decks can be located at-grade or elevated above grade. Dumpers located at grade require a deep below-grade pit >30’ deep (9.1m) to house the large receiving hopper, which is usually sized to hold 1.5 truckloads of material. Elevating the material out of a deep pit requires a long belt conveyor. Below-grade pits can often be a problem in areas with high water-tables.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Drive-through dumpers are often located 10’ – 20’ (3m-6m) above grade, the intent being to minimize the depth of the below-grade receiving pit. Above-grade, drive-through dumpers require long ramps at each end of the dumper, gently sloped for the trucks to drive on and off the dumper; this can result in a very large footprint for the drive-through dumper system. For example, a 10’ (3m) high ramp at 5% slope is 200’ (60m) long. So, the total footprint size for an above-ground dumper installation including ramps and truck turning circle can be between 60’-80’ wide by 500’-600’ long (18m-24m by 152m-183m).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Back-on dumpers are available in an extended-arm configuration that permits the receiving hopper to be mounted above-grade or slightly below grade. Extended arm dumpers lift the truck above the above-grade hopper, so are limited to 80’ (24.3m) long decks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"cycle-times-and-throughput-rates\">Cycle Times and Throughput Rates\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Recommended cycle times for end-tippers are, deck up – 1 minute and 55 seconds, and deck down – 1 minute and 30 seconds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dumper throughput rates depend upon: the truck staging time, the dumper cycle time, the receiving hopper run-out time, and the truck exit time. Typical throughput rates for drive-through dumpers are 5 trucks per hour average and 6 trucks per hour maximum.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fast cycle rates are important to reduce the time the trucks are on the millsite, thereby reducing demurrage charges. Some large pulp and paper mills have multiple dumpers processing up to 250 Super B-train trucks per day, so demurrage charges can be significant if trucks are delayed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Typical throughput rates for back-on dumpers are quite a bit less, 3-4 trucks per hour average on the large dumpers. However, if the deck is too short to handle coupled dual trailers, then each trailer must be uncoupled and dumped separately, which greatly increases the truck cycle time to a maximum of 3 trailers per hour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"dumper-structures\">Dumper Structures\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Dumpers require heavy foundations to resist the truck and chip dead loads, the shifting pivot loads, the shifting hydraulic cylinder loads, the wind loads and the dynamic loads from chip payloads falling 60’ (18.3m) from a truck into a receiving hopper. The concrete pits required to hold a receiving hopper are deep and large. The tunnel required for the belt conveyor from the receiving hopper is large and long.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As noted, above-grade dumpers need long in and out ramps. And, unless the dumper is situated in an open field, retaining walls are often required to keep the ramps from impinging on adjacent buildings or structures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Control booths are required. A control booth, with typical dimensions of 6’ x 8’ x 8’ (1.8 x 1.8 x 2.4m), should be equipped with large windows, anti-slip flooring, HVAC, control panel, good lighting, intercom with the mill control room and a card reader.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The dumper hydraulic power unit (HPU) should be located inside an enclosure to protect it from the weather, particularly in cold climates. The enclosure should have filtered make-up air to prevent wood dust from accumulating on the HPU.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"control-devices\">Control Devices\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Back-on dumpers should be equipped with the following minimum control devices:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Deck upper and lower limit switches.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Deck position indication (Temposonic cylinder), to control deck speed at the cylinder transition points.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Truck location photocells.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Wind-speed sensor.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Drive-through dumpers have the additional control devices:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Bridge upper and lower limit switches.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Backstop upper and lower limit switches.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Backstop safety pin position switch.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>As a minimum, the hydraulic power unit (HPU) should have:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>High and low oil pressure switches.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Oil temperature sensors and switches.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>High and low oil level switches.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Air/oil cooler and oil heater.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"description-of-typical-dumper-operation\">Description of Typical Dumper Operation\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Trucks enter the millsite and typically drive onto a truck weighscale where the trucks are weighed and other pertinent information is recorded, including: trucking company, truck #, source and type of product, species, weight, etc. This information is often recorded on printed bar code cards. After weighing-in, the truck drives off the weighscale and drives to the truck staging area located before the truck dumper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A set of traffic lights is often used to control the truck traffic to the dumper. When the dumper is available, the traffic light turns to green to signal that the next truck can drive onto the dumper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"drive-through-dumper-operation\">Drive-Through Dumper Operation\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Following is a description of a typical dumping sequence for a drive-through dumper. Most dumpers are operated by the truck driver. When the traffic light turns green, the driver drives the truck over the drive-over bridge and onto the dumper deck. As the truck enters the dumper, a photocell turns the traffic light to red.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At a local control station, the driver operates controls to position the backstop, before backing the truck up against the backstop. The driver then engages the truck brakes, dumps the air from the air suspension system and stops the truck engine. After leaving the truck cab, the driver opens the trailer doors, engages a safety pin in the backstop and places a collecting bucket under the chip sample spout, if he is required to take a sample. He then enters the control booth where he scans his truck information card in a card-reader before starting the dump sequence.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The operating system’s programmable logic controller (PLC) should be programmed such that the dumping sequence cannot be started until the truck information has been scanned, the receiving hopper is empty of the previous truck load and the backstop pin is engaged. Upon receiving approval from the PLC to start the dump sequence, the driver presses and holds a ‘Dump’ button, and the drive-over bridge rises up.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once the bridge is up, the dumper deck will start to rise up. The driver must hold the dump button continuously or the dumping sequence will stop and the bridge and deck will hold in position. The purpose for this is to ensure the driver is safely inside the control booth whenever the dumper is in operation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As the deck rises, the material load in the pup trailer pushes the back doors open (at ~35° – 40° deck slope) and the chips start to slide out of the trailer and into the receiving hopper. When the pup trailer is empty, the material load in the lead trailer pushes against and opens the lift panel on the front of the pup trailer and the chips slide out of the lead trailer and through the pup trailer and into the receiving hopper. Total trailer emptying time is approximately 1 minute.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chip samples should be taken by an automatic chip sampler while the truck is dumping and the live-bottom hopper is metering the chips into the conveyor system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the dumper deck is all the way up, the driver will be able to operate the backstop vibrators to loosen frozen chips, if required. The PLC should be programmed to control the timing and limit the amount the vibrators can be used. The PLC must also be programmed to not allow the operator to rapidly jog the dumper ‘up’ and ‘down’ in an effort to shake loose stuck chips, as this can cause the truck to bounce on the inclined deck and possibly jump over the backstop and fall into the receiving hopper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the trailers are empty, the driver releases the Dump button and presses a ‘Down’ button and the dumper deck will start to lower back down onto its supports. When the dumper deck is all the way down, the drive-over bridge will lower back into place. If the driver releases the Down button the deck and bridge will stop and hold in position.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the deck and bridge are back down on their stops, the driver leaves the control booth, removes the backstop safety pin, transfers his chip sample from the collection bucket into a sample bag and attaches his truck information. He then enters his truck, starts the engine, engages the air suspension, releases the brakes, drives forward off the dumper deck, stops and closes his trailer doors. As the trailer pulls off the dumper deck, a photocell automatically moves the backstop out of the way ready for the next truck and turns the traffic light to green.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The driver of the empty truck drives back to the truck scales, weighs out and leaves the site. Some dumper decks have an integral truck scale built into the dumper deck, which helps to reduce the truck turn-around times.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"back-on-dumper-operation\">Back-On Dumper Operation\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The sequence is much the same as for a drive-through dumper with the following exceptions:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>There is no drive-over bridge so the trucks are backed onto the dumper and driven off from the same end.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The backstop is fixed in place, so the driver doesn’t have to be concerned with the backstop operation.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"portable-and-transportable-trailer-dumpers\">Portable and Transportable Trailer Dumpers\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Portable and transportable trailer dumpers with short decks are available and are generally used in temporary circumstances for dumping small trucks or separated trailers. Portable dumpers are equipped with truck axles and wheels and can be towed from location to location. Transportable dumpers are hauled to location on flat-bed trucks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The dumpers are equipped with outriggers on each side to minimize the risk of the dumper toppling sideways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Portable / transportable dumpers are often located on top of an earthen ramp contained by a retaining wall, over which they dump the trailer loads onto a paved pad. A front-end loader then pushes the chips away before a second trailer can be emptied. A strong concrete pad is recommended for sitting the portable / transportable dumper on. With all the decoupling and recoupling required, the maximum throughput rate for a portable / transportable dumper is 3 trailers per hour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"side-tippers\">Side Tippers\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The quality of residual wastewood (hog fuel) can vary considerably from loose sawdust to dry, curled bark, to green, ropy bark, and often is very difficult to handle. Material transport over long distances is most economical if large capacity Super B-Train truck / trailer combinations are used but these trailers loaded with hog fuel are difficult to handle on a conventional end-tipper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Side-tipping dumpers have a platform that tips the trucks to one side. Side-tippers are not common; the author knows of only one in existence that is used for emptying trailers filled with processed hog fuel in an extreme northern climate. This hog fuel dumper (HFTD) was developed because hog fuel tends to be wetter than wood chips and freezes inside conventional trailers on long haul distances and is difficult to empty out of conventional end-discharge chip / biomass trailers, particularly coupled B-Trains. In cold weather on a conventional end-tipper, it is necessary to decouple the trailers and empty them separately, which is a time consuming and not always effective practice. Once biomass has frozen inside a trailer, the only solutions are to accept the payload loss or park the trailer indoors and let it thaw out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Side-tipping dumpers require special trailers that have one side that opens. The open area is 4-5 times as great as that on a conventional end-discharge trailer. When the trailers are tipped to the side, the hog fuel mass is not restrained and falls quite easily out of the large open area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Side-tippers have the following features and accessories:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Drive-through style.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Deck long enough so that decoupling is not required.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Deck tips to one side by hydraulic cylinders.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Truck hold-down chains are required because the load passes the center of gravity (CG) when tipped.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A hydraulic power unit (HPU).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A very long, above-grade receiving hopper, to match the overall trailer discharge length.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Approach and exit ramps.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Maximum throughput on a side-tipper is approximately 4 Super B-Trains per hour depending upon the ability of the downstream conveying equipment to handle the variable quality of the hog fuel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"side-tipping-self-unloading-trailer-boxes\">Side-tipping, Self-unloading Trailer Boxes\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Side-tipping, self-unloading trailers deserve to be discussed in more detail here. These trailers have been used successfully for hauling processed wastewood (hog fuel) in northern British Columbia (BC), Canada, which experiences very cold winters where hog fuel tends to freeze inside the trailer boxes on long hauls. These side-tipping trailer boxes have sides that open full-length, similar to those side-opening trailers used on the side-tipping dumper platform, with one significant difference; they don’t need a trailer tipper / dumper to empty. Rather than tipping the entire trailer, the boxes tip sideways on an integral heavy steel trailer frame.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As with the side-tipping dumper platform, the side-tipping trailers go past the center of gravity when tipping. In order to prevent the trailer from capsizing sideways, it is necessary to drive the entire coupled truck / trailer unit slowly in a tight arc as first one then the other trailer is tipped and emptied. In this manner, the truck / trailer arc prevents the over-center trailer from capsizing. Unfortunately, this dumping method spreads the material over a considerable area, which must then be cleaned-up by a front-end loader.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If dumping into a receiving hopper, the stationary, side-tipping trailers must be chained-down before tipping the trailer boxes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the big disadvantages of the side-tipping trailers is that the heavy steel trailer frame reduces the allowable payload significantly, which is a concern over long haul distances.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"safety\">Safety\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In addition to the common safety procedures in place in all wood processing plants, there are a few practices that are particular to the operation of a biomass truck dumper.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>No one should be on or under the dumper deck or bridge when the dumper is in operation.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Do not operate the dumper above the manufacturer’s recommended wind speed, usually 40 mph (64kph).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Clean snow and debris off the dumper deck before operating.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Do not rapidly jog the dumper deck ‘up’ and ‘down’ in an attempt to shake loose stuck chips.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Do not overfill the receiving hopper.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Ensure that stationary side-tipping trucks are properly restrained by chain ‘hold-downs’ to prevent them from capsizing when the load goes over-center.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"receiving-hoppers-and-outstocking-system\">Receiving Hoppers and Outstocking System\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Live-bottom receiving hoppers are most commonly multi-strand, drag-chain conveyors, but ‘shuffle-floor’ (walking-floor) hoppers are sometimes used. The receiving hopper should be large enough to contain approximately 1 ½ truckloads. If the outstocking system is properly designed, the receiving hopper should be empty and ready to receive the next truckload by the time the next full truck is on the dumper deck and ready to dump. The live-bottom hopper should have a fixed discharge opening and a variable speed drive for accurately metering the chips onto the outstocking conveyor.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Belt conveyors are most commonly used to convey the chips from the receiving hopper to the storage area, but must be properly designed for the operating conditions. The minimum recommended belt size for a large truck dumper is 48” wide (1219mm) operating at 450 fpm (2.29mps). The belt conveyor should be equipped with a belt weighscale for measuring the material throughput. It is recommended that a self-cleaning magnet be installed over the conveyor discharge pulley for removing tramp ferrous metal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The belt conveyor should discharge onto a scalping screen, the intent being to remove any large pieces of material such as frozen lumps that could jam-up or damage downstream equipment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"chip-sampling\">Chip Sampling\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Most pulp and paper mills require that chips be sampled for quality reasons when delivered to the mill site. The obvious place to take chip samples is at the dumper when the trucks are being emptied. However, taking grab samples from the chip trailer is notoriously inaccurate and produces misleading conclusions regarding chip quality. It is imperative that a properly designed chip sampling device be installed and operated to give a true, representative sample of the material being delivered.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"dust-control\">Dust Control\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>6,000 ft³ (170m³) of biomass suddenly sliding 60’ (18.3m) into a receiving hopper generates a considerable amount of dust. Few dumper installations try to control this dust, but it is an issue that is starting to receive attention from both health and environmental perspectives. It is possible to install an enclosure over the dumper pit and bridge, but it would require a fast-acting door on the drive-in side and a massive dust collector to keep the enclosure under a negative pressure to prevent fugitive dusting. The dust collector should also be connected to downstream conveyor transfer points.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some installations have tried ‘fogging’ systems which lay down a blanket of fog to which dust particles attach to water particles. These are finicky systems and may work in warm climates, but are not appropriate for cold climates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"chip-contamination-by-dirt-sand-rocks-snow-and-ice\">Chip Contamination by Dirt, Sand, Rocks, Snow and Ice\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The outside and underside of the chip trucks can become contaminated by dirt, sand, rocks, snow and ice, as they travel along the roads and highways to the millsite. The contaminants often fall from the truck during the dumping process and end up being discharged into the wood chip furnish to the pulp mill. One study conducted showed an average of 200 kg (440 lbs) of snow, ice, dirt, sand and rocks falling off every chip truck at the truck dumper. The sand and rocks can cause considerable damage to downstream equipment in the pulpmill and biomass boiler, and should be prevented from entering the chip flow to the mill.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"dumper-vendors\">Dumper Vendors\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are many companies that manufacture end-tippers.

And with the increased movement to utilizing biomass as a fuel source, more companies are discovering the difficulty in accurately measuring biomass inventory.\n\nThe traditional method of determining inventory has been to measure the volume of a pile and from that back-calculate the tonnage. However, accurately determining the amount of fibre in biomass piles has long been problematic and even today with accurate measuring devices, fibre measurement doesn't have an easy solution.\n\nPulp and paper mills everywhere have struggled with this problem for years. One year they will have to write-off wood chip inventory that appears to have disappeared; the next year they will have too much inventory. Other facilities that utilize biomass have similar inventory assessment problems.\n\n## Volume Measurement\n\nPile size and volume is measured by surveying and years ago the lack of accuracy was accepted and used to explain inventory variances. With current measuring technology, the volume measurement accuracy has greatly improved and yet the estimate of actual fibre remaining in the pile is still not very accurate. Generally, the problem lies with not knowing the amount of compaction and the consequent density inside the pile. Without this knowledge, back-calculating tonnage from a volume measurement is quite 'hit and miss'.\n\nThere are several methods of measuring pile volume, including LIDAR (light detecting and ranging) and non-LIDAR flyovers, ground GPS (global positioning system) survey and laser survey. Ground-based, 3D laser scanning likely provides the most accurate volume measurement for the cost.\n\n## 'Rule of Thumb' Conversion Factors\n\nMost plants utilize arbitrary, 'rule of thumb' density conversion factors based on historical data to convert from volume to tonnage. Unfortunately, the characteristics of biomass can vary widely even within the same pile and no two piles will be the same, even if they are believed to be of the same material and constructed in the same manner. Utilizing 'rule-of-thumb' conversion factors will invariably lead to inventory errors. Any inventory method that is based upon volume (m³) or green tonnes (Gt) will not produce accurate results as neither reflect the true amount of fibre present. Chip flows and inventory should be tracked using mass in bone dry tonnes (BDt) only.\n\n## Compaction / Density\n\nWhile volume can be accurately measured, there is no easy way of measuring compaction or density deep inside a pile. In fact, density varies throughout the pile and to accurately calculate the pile tonnage (BDt), you would need to have a 3D density profile and a complex algorithm to relate it to the volume.\n\nDensity varies according to moisture content and degree of compaction. And, moisture content will change depending upon the climate, how long the chips are stored and the amount of compaction. Loosely compacted chips dry out faster.\n\nCompaction varies depending upon the size and depth of the pile, the size of the particles in the pile, and the type of dozer driving over the pile, if any. The larger and deeper the pile, the greater will be the natural compaction. The density near the pile edges will be significantly less than near the middle.\n\nBecause of their smaller tire footprint, rubber-tired vehicles compact the chips more than do tracked vehicles. Smaller particles compact differently than do larger particles, so particle segregation within a pile will result in different densities.\n\nParticle size segregation naturally occurs as a pile is being built; larger particles tend to roll down the surface to the outer edges of the pile. Additionally, size segregation is greatly affected by wind, which will concentrate fine particles in one part of the pile. So, even if one were able to sample pile density, the results could vary significantly depending upon where in the pile the samples were taken.\n\nSome studies have shown that the density deep inside a large pile can increase by 25-30% over the surface density and the overall pile density can increase by 14-15%.\n\nEach pile is different and it is next to impossible to predict pile density with any accuracy based on historical data.\n\n## Pile Density Measurement\n\nNuclear depth density gauges are used successfully on large coal storage piles. This technique requires multiple bore holes into the pile into which plastic pipes are inserted and a nuclear density / moisture content gauge is lowered and measurements taken every couple of feet to make a 3D density and moisture map of the pile. This is a costly and time consuming process that is necessary if you are dealing with multiple 500,000 tonne piles of coal, but probably not economic on smaller biomass piles.\n\n## Losses Due to Biological Action and Spontaneous Combustion\n\nBiological action within a biomass pile can result in fibre losses, which can have an effect on the fibre usage numbers. Some studies show that up to 1% of useful fibre can be lost per month of storage due to biological action, so this must be taken into account when rationalizing pile losses. Studies also show that the losses due to biological action are lower in highly compacted piles where the amount of oxygen is lower.\n\nPile turn-over has an effect on residence time and therefore on biological action. Few biomass piles are handled in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner and therefore residence time can vary greatly. Biological action is affected by the type and species of biomass being handled, moisture content and the amount of oxygen present.\n\nAdditionally, fibre loss can occur due to spontaneous combustion from biomass stored too long in a pile.\n\n## Multi-Pile Storage System\n\nIf possible, use a multiple pile system where piles are routinely 'zeroed-out', or emptied completely several times a year; this way the inventory can be rationalized more frequently so that errors don't accumulate. This also minimizes losses due to biological action and spontaneous combustion.\n\nUtilizing a multi-pile system sounds easy, but I know it is not always practical, particularly if the storage area is space-limited or if you are already dealing with multiple species in multiple piles. Pile management with odd-hour deliveries and multiple species blending can make fibre tracking a headache.\n\nOne option with multiple piles is to keep the pile-building function completely separate from the reclaiming function. That is, build a pile with a discrete amount of chips, then empty it. i.e. – don't reclaim while the pile is being built and don't add to the pile when it is being emptied. This system of pile management that utilizes discrete amounts of chips, keeps the in / out calculations simpler.\n\n## Accurately Determining the Amount of Fibre in a Pile\n\nIn light of the difficulty of determining pile density, how can one accurately determine the tonnage (BDt) of woody biomass contained within a pile? Following are some suggestions.\n\n- Ensure frequent pile turn-over, to minimize losses due to biological action or spontaneous combustion.\n- Utilize a multiple storage pile system.\n- Do not track biomass inventory on a volumetric (m³) or green weight (Gt) basis, as neither reflect the true amount of fibre present.\n- Do not rely on 'rule of thumb' conversion factors to convert between volume, wet weight and mass.\n- Abandon the quest to determine compaction or an average density inside the pile. Unless you are going to measure the density of every pile, the result would be meaningless for subsequent pile inventory purposes.\n- Rely on accurate measuring of the flows into and out of the chip pile. Utilize multiple, redundant scales on both the infeed and outfeed from a pile, so that malfunctioning scales can be quickly identified; and, recalibrate the scales at least twice per year, summer and winter.\n- Measure the moisture content (MC) of both the incoming and outgoing biomass so that the BDt can be calculated from the Gt scale measurements.\n- Track the tonnage in BDt rather than in Gt or in m³, neither of which remain constant.\n- Moisture content can be measured by on-line moisture sensors or by lab analysis of chip samples from both incoming and outgoing chip flows.\n- The amount of fibre remaining in a pile (BDt) at any one time would be the difference between the incoming and outgoing amounts.\n\n## Determining Average Pile Compaction / Density\n\nIf one really needs to determine the average amount of compaction or average density of a pile of chips, you could do so by adding a survey step into the above procedure:\n\n- Build the pile in the normal way.\n- Stop the feed onto the pile and the reclaim from the pile.\n- Survey the pile to determine the volume before reclaiming the pile.\n- Reclaim and measure the Gt and MC of the outgoing fibre and calculate the BDt.\n- Take frequent samples of the reclaimed biomass and calculate the loose density (BDt/m³) of the samples per established lab procedures.\n- Empty the pile completely.\n- Divide the total outgoing tonnage (BDt) by the surveyed volume (m³) to get the average pile density (BDt/m³). And, compare this density to the lab sample density to calculate the amount of compaction.\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

Introduction\n\nPulpmills are among the largest users of woody biomass and typically store and process huge volumes of wood chips prior to the pulping process. Storage volumes of 120,000 BDt (750,000 m³) are not uncommon. The value of these chips is in the tens of millions of dollars, so mills have very specific requirements for storing wood chips to minimize fibre losses and maximize fibre recovery.\n\nThings to consider when designing chip storage piles include: the material being handled, total required storage volume, practical live-storage volume, fibre aging, pile turn-over, dry fibre loss, chip degradation and breakage, dust and fire control, inventory management, the methods of pile-building and reclaiming, etc.\n\nThis article covers these topics in a general manner. Other articles that contain more information on each topic are listed at the end of this article and can be seen elsewhere on the Advanced Biomass website.\n\n## 2. Material Handled\n\nIn order to design and manage chip piles the following basic material information is required.\n\n| Material Property | Example |\n|------------------|---------|\n| **Species** | Softwood Mix: Spruce, Pine Fir |\n| **Basic Wood Density (bone dry)** | 24.0 BD lb/ft³ avg. |\n| **Moisture Content** | 40-50%, wet basis |\n| **Bulking Factor** | 2.70; solid wood to loose chips |\n| **Chip Type** | Residual chips or from whole logs |\n| **Bulk Density (wet)** | 14.8 – 17.8 lb/ft³ (238 – 286 kg/m³) |\n| **Material Size** | 100% \u003C 4\" (100 mm)\u003Cbr>85% \u003C2\" (50 mm)\u003Cbr>Max 5% \u003C1/8\" (3 mm) |\n\n## 3. Pile Size / Storage Volume\n\nThe mill must store enough chips in order not to inhibit pulp production; however, inventory is costly, so the mill will not want to store excessive volumes unnecessarily. Following are the parameters that affect chip storage volume and the footprint area required.\n\n- **Required Throughput to Pulpmill** – some mills with secure and reliable chip delivery methods operate on a 'just-in-time' delivery regime with a minimum of 1-4 week's supply of chips.\n\n- **Fibre Aging Requirement** – Some pulping processes require that the wood chips be aged, sometimes up to (3) months.\n\n- **Different Species** – Some mills utilize different softwood (SW) or hardwood (HW) species in various blends and must keep them separate in storage. Also, they must receive the different chip species as they are produced and delivered to the mill, which often does not correspond to the time that they are actually being used for pulp.\n\n- **Different Densities** – Different species when chipped can have different bulk densities, so the amount of dry fibre in a given volume will vary somewhat between species.\n\n- **Different Grades / Types** – Some mills receive different grades or types of wood chips that must be stored separately.\n\n- **Compaction** – Compaction naturally occurs in all biomass piles, but can be artificially induced by mobile equipment running on top. An average of 15% compaction is not uncommon.\n\n- **Dry-fibre Loss** – The amount of dry fibre loss resulting from bacteriological action and oxidation varies depending upon the species, temperature, moisture content, amount of O₂ present or not present, storage time, pile shape, etc. and can be significant. Dry fibre loss cannot be avoided but should be minimized; and at the least should be provided for, particularly when accounting for inventory.\n\n- **Storage Form** – In some cases where wood species deteriorate rapidly in chip form and storage time is long, it would be better to store the wood in log form rather than as chips; and process the logs into chips on-site closer to the time they are required in the pulpmill.\n\n- **Available Storage Space** – Space is a big factor when determining pile size and shape. For example, automatic live-storage systems are not the most space efficient and generally require a large footprint, so if the required amount of storage volume is large in comparison to the space available, this might preclude or minimize the amount of live-storage. I have seen some mills with limited storage area where there is just one big pile and there is no delineation between species.\n\n- **Planned Delivery Interruptions** – Delivery times are often affected by climate or forest access restrictions. In northern Canada, access to the forest is sometimes limited to 100 days during the winter when the ground is frozen and to protect some animal species under the 'species at risk' act. In some tropical forests, access to the forest is restricted to the dry season. These predictable delivery interruptions can generally be planned around and enough chips stored to eliminate mill shutdowns due to low inventory.\n\n- **Unplanned Delivery Interruptions** – Sometimes other things unexpectedly stop or restrict chip delivery into the mill; for example, forest fires, labour disputes, shut down of the plants supplying residual chips, etc. These are difficult to plan for but must be considered and contingency back-up plans provided.\n\n- **Contractual Requirements** – Most mills have long-term purchase agreements with suppliers and must have space to be able to continue to receive wood chips, even when the pulpmill is shut down and not using chips.\n\n- **Pile Turn-over** – Space is required to manage the chip pile. To ensure an orderly pile turn-over, you do not want to be dropping fresh chips on top of old chips, unless you have a FIFO reclaim system.\n\n## 4. LIFO and FIFO Storage Piles\n\n### Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) Storage\n\nMost manually built and reclaimed chip storage piles have LIFO storage, with the chips on top of the pile being used first. This leads to the situation where the newest and freshest chips are being used first and the oldest and most degraded chips are being used last. This is not an ideal situation from a fibre-loss perspective nor from a chip quality perspective, which has an effect on digester operation and throughput.\n\nHowever, some studies indicate that the highest rate of decay occurs in the first few days after chips have been manufactured, then tends to level out. Consequently, some theorize that if fibre-loss is your greatest concern, then fresh-cut chips should be used immediately before they have time to decay.\n\n### First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Storage\n\nFrom a fibre degradation perspective, FIFO storage is considered to be the most desirable, as the oldest chips are used first. Additionally, the chip retention time in the pile and consequent fibre degradation for all chips remains fairly constant, which minimizes one variable affecting chip and pulp quality.\n\nFIFO storage is hard to achieve reliably without an automatic pile building and reclaim system.\n\n## 5. Live-Storage / Dead Storage\n\nLive-storage refers to the volume of chips that is located over / under a reclaimer and that can be reclaimed automatically without operator intervention. Generally from an operating cost perspective, the more live-storage, the better.\n\nLive-storage requires mechanical devices that reclaim the chips from the pile.\n\nDead areas of the pile that do not have live-storage, require mobile equipment to reclaim the chips. Steel-tracked dozers and rubber-tired front-end loaders (FEL's) are most commonly used, and have higher operating costs than do automatic reclaim systems.\n\n## 6. Chip Degradation and Breakage\n\n### Biological Activity and Oxidation\n\nWood fibre degrades from biological activity and oxidation resulting in fibre losses. This has been well-documented in many studies. Some studies show that more than 1% of useful fibre can be lost per month of storage due to biological action and oxidation. Consequently, the mill must bring in more material to make up for this loss, which can involve substantial additional costs.\n\nBiological action is affected by the type and species of biomass being handled, moisture content, temperature, and the amount of oxygen present. With sufficient oxygen, fibre degradation will increase as the moisture content and temperature increase.\n\nSome studies show that the losses due to oxidation are lower in highly compacted piles where the amount of oxygen is restricted. Other studies have shown that if air flow is enhanced, generated heat can be dissipated and biological action slowed down, which in turn reduces the amount of heat generated.\n\nNon-organic material in the chips is not affected by microbial action, so, as a side effect of dry fibre loss, the non-organic content rises when expressed as a percentage of the dry fibre left. Therefore, the higher the dry fibre losses, the higher the non-organic content in the chips delivered to the digester.\n\n### Breakage\n\nEvery time chips are handled, they break-up into smaller pieces. Breakage occurs at truck dumpers, in chain conveyors, at belt conveyor transfers, and in screening systems. The greatest amount of chip breakage occurs in pneumatic conveyors and from mobile equipment driving on chip piles.\n\nStudies have shown that significantly higher breakage occurs from rubber-tired vehicles driving over chips than from steel-tracked vehicles, primarily from the smaller footprint and higher pressures.\n\n### Particle Size\n\nParticle size within a biomass pile has a big effect on moisture absorption, heat build-up / dissipation and dry fibre losses. Piles containing a large amount of fines absorb greater amounts of water, generally heat up faster due to greater microbial action, and restrict air movement through the pile, thereby limiting heat dissipation; all of this leading to increased dry fibre loss and possibly spontaneous combustion.\n\nConversely, piles consisting of large wood chunks heat up more slowly, permit better air flow due to the large voids, dissipate the heat faster due to better air circulation, have lower rates of microbial action and lower dry fibre losses.\n\nRegular chip sampling is necessary to ensure the incoming material meets contractual requirements and also to ensure that the chips being fed to the digester meet the proper size distribution.\n\nAlso refer to the article titled \"Biomass Storage Pile Basics\".\n\n## 7. Pile Reclaiming Methods\n\nThere are many storage and reclaim systems available and each has its place. Choosing the right system depends upon: the material being handled; the total amount of storage required; the amount of live-storage required; the need or not for first-in / first-out flow; the ability to accurately meter chips; the need for mixing / blending; and whether covered storage is required or not.\n\nGenerally, fully automatic systems with 100% live-storage are prohibitively costly and most projects that I have been involved in, end up with something significantly less than 100% live-storage, usually with enough for a few hours of operation with no operator intervention.\n\nThere are many different types of reclaimers, including:\n\n- Under-pile chain reclaimers\n- Under-pile screw reclaimers\n- Over-pile chain reclaimers\n- Over-pile 'scratcher' reclaimers\n- Under-pile vibrating floor reclaimers\n- Under-pile 'shuffle-floor' reclaimers\n- Under-pile stoker reclaimers\n- Moving-Hole reclaimers\n\n### Under-pile Chain Reclaimers\n\nUnder-pile chain reclaimers consist of multiple strands of drag chain lining the bottom of a receiving hopper, over which the storage pile is built. The receiving hopper is equipped with a metering gate at the opening and the live-bottom chains are usually equipped with variable speed drives for varying the amount of chips metered from the hopper. Under-pile chain reclaimers are generally the most common type of reclaimer and have the lowest capital cost. Unfortunately, they have the smallest live-storage capacity and tend to bridge.\n\n### Under-pile Screw Reclaimers\n\nThe rotary, under-pile screw reclaimer consists of a tapered, variable pitch, variable speed screw slewing about a central point. The screw draws the material from the bottom of the pile to the center pivot point where it discharges through an opening into a conveyor located below. Rotary, under-pile screw reclaimers work well and do a good job of mixing but are fairly costly. Live-storage quantities are limited to 12-24 hours.\n\nTraveling, under-pile screw reclaimers have screws similar to the rotary, under-pile screw; but the screws are mounted on a carriage, which traverses on a set of rails along one side of the chip pile. The traveling screw removes material from the bottom of the pile and discharges it into a belt conveyor traveling along one edge of the pile. Traveling, under-pile, screw reclaimers work well, do a good job of mixing and can have a large live-storage volume of many days. Unfortunately, they are very costly and require a large footprint.\n\nBecause they are cutting across the bottom of the pile, under-pile chain reclaimers do a good job of FIFO reclaiming and mixing material from striated piles.\n\nUnder-pile screw reclaimers require high HP drives and cause chip damage due to the shearing action between the rotating screw and the chips sitting above the screw.\n\n### Over-pile Chain Reclaimers\n\nOver-pile chain reclaimers are used to reclaim material from longitudinal or circular conical piles. They consist of a dual strand chain, flight conveyor that is mounted on a luffing boom. The boom is lowered onto the top of the pile and the chain conveyor drags material off the pile into a conveyor system. The chain conveyor traverses longitudinally back-and-forth along the top of the pile, taking nominal cuts off the surface of the pile. After reclaiming a section of the storage pile, the reclaimer is re-positioned to another section of the pile. Limited FIFO is possible.\n\nThe rotary, over-pile chain reclaimer is usually mounted on and rotates about a central column, and is often mated with a circular stacker conveyor which is mounted on and rotates about the same column. Depending upon the required chip throughput and the size of the reclaimer, rotary, over-pile chain reclaimers can have live-storage of several days.\n\nThe longitudinal, over-pile chain reclaimer is mounted on a travelling carriage which traverses along rails, and is usually mated with a separate longitudinal belt stacker. Longitudinal conical piles can be quite long and therefore can contain a much greater quantity of chips.\n\nDepending upon their design, over-pile chain reclaimers can provide >80% live-storage. But, they are much more costly than under-pile chain reclaimers.\n\nAs they are being constructed, most conical piles tend to concentrate the fines in the center and top of the pile while the larger particles roll to the outside edge. Consequently, the average particle size of the material being reclaimed by an over-pile chain reclaimer can vary considerably, depending upon where the reclaimer is operating within the pile.\n\n### Over-pile Scratcher Reclaimers\n\nThis type of reclaimer consists of a large frame with rake teeth that is lowered onto the inclined surface of a circular, conical pile. The frame oscillates back-and-forth on the pile causing the chips to trickle down the face of the pile. When they reach the bottom edge of the pile, the chips are swept-up by a chain conveyor, which moves the chips to the conveyor system. The over-pile scratcher reclaimer is usually mated with and follows a stacker conveyor, which builds the pile ahead of the reclaimer. This stacker / reclaimer combination gives true FIFO.\n\n### Under-pile Vibrating Floor Reclaimers\n\nThere are several makes of under-pile vibrating floor reclaimers, but they all rely on a declining vibrating pan that moves the chips along to a conveyor, when the pan vibrates. They are almost always used under silos or bins, not in open piles.\n\n### Shuffle-Floor Reclaimers\n\nLive-bottom, 'shuffle-floors' are sometimes used as reclaimers in the bottom of bins. For a description of how these shuffle-floors work, go to the Keith Walking Floor website. [http://www.keithwalkingfloor.com/](http://www.keithwalkingfloor.com/)\n\n### Stoker Reclaimers\n\nStoker reclaimers consist of a series of horizontal 'ladders' that mount in the bottom of a pile or bin. The ladders stroke back-and-forth and the ladder rungs pull the material from the bottom of the pile forward to a conveyor system. Ladder-stoker reclaimers have been available for decades, are quite reliable and are most often used when handling wastewood hog fuel.\n\n### Moving-Hole Reclaimers\n\nWhen mated with a mass-flow bin, the 'moving-hole' reclaimer does an excellent job of reclaiming difficult-to-handle materials with poor flow characteristics, as it does not impart compression forces into the material above the reclaimer. For a description of the 'moving-hole' concept go to the Kamengo website. [http://www.kamengo.com/](http://www.kamengo.com/)\n\n## 8. Pile Building Methods\n\nPile building can be accomplished by mobile equipment, over-pile belt or chain conveyors, slewing / luffing stackers, or pneumatic conveyors. The type of pile builder is often dictated by the type of reclaimer.\n\n### Mobile Equipment\n\nChips are conveyed to and dropped onto a chip storage pad. Either a rubber-tired, front-end loader (FEL) or a tracked 'dozer' is used to push the chips away from the drop point and push them up into a pile. The same mobile equipment is often used for reclaiming the chips from the pile(s) and pushing them into a live-bottom reclaimer, which meters the chips into a conveyor system to the chip screening system.\n\n### Over-Pile Belt Outstocking Conveyor\n\nThis type of pile builder utilizes a belt conveyor that passes over the top of the chip storage pad. The belt conveyor is housed inside a gallery that is suspended between concrete pylons. The belt conveyor discharges chips through multiple plows or fixed trippers onto the chip pad below. Occasionally, a traveling tripper is used to build a continuous, conical pile. Sometimes, telescopic chutes are used under the drop points to minimize dusting. Chain conveyors are sometimes used as outstocking conveyors over short piles.\n\n### Chip Flingers\n\nChip flingers are often used under conveyor drop points for spreading the chips across the top of the pile. Flingers consist of a short, high-speed belt (4,000 fpm) that can luff and slew to distribute the chips up to a 140' radius from the drop point. Chip flingers are notorious for producing particle segregation in the chip piles.\n\n### Stacker Conveyors\n\nStacker conveyors can build either a longitudinal conical pile or a circular conical pile. They consist of a luffing belt conveyor mounted on a cantilevered truss. Material is fed onto the lower end of the conveyor and discharged over the cantilevered end onto the pile.\n\nLongitudinal stackers are mounted on travelling carriages which traverse along rails. The circular stacker is mounted on and rotates (slews) about a central column. The circular stacker is most often married to a circular over-pile chain reclaimer, which is mounted to and rotates about the same central column.\n\n### Pneumatic Stackers\n\nPneumatic conveyors are rarely used for transporting pulp chips because they cause significant chip damage and have high power requirements. However, there are a few still in use.\n\nPneumatic stackers can be simple, fixed pipes blowing chips onto a pile, or they can be equipped with cyclones mounted on carriages that slew about a central point and build conical piles.\n\n### Equipment Sizing\n\nThe type of outstocking / pile building method selected must be able to handle the maximum flow being delivered to it. For example, the flow rate from a chip truck dumper is usually much higher than the overall average chip flow to the pile.\n\n## 9. Contamination Issues\n\nAssume that the incoming raw material will be contaminated, possibly with dirt, rocks, grit and metal, and snow and ice in northern climates; the amounts of which should be minimized prior to the chips being introduced into the digester chip bin, as they can cause damage to the downstream brownstock equipment and degrade pulp quality and production.\n\nFerrous metal is relatively easy to remove with self-cleaning magnets, but to be effective, care must be taken with magnet placement and orientation.\n\nLarge rocks and frozen lumps can be removed with disc scalping screens. Dirt, grit, snow, ice, small stones and other such small non-organics are usually removed in the chip screening system along with the chip fines, which are often used for fuel in a biomass-fired cogeneration plant.\n\nEquipment is available to segregate and remove 'heavies' from the chip flow, but it is generally a costly enterprise.\n\nThe best solution to minimize contamination is to utilize methods that reduce the amounts of these materials getting into the hog fuel in the first place, including:\n\n- Load chips directly into storage bins or trucks when making the chips.\n- Don't store processed chips on un-paved surfaces where they can pick up rocks, dirt and grit.\n- Ensure that the contamination that builds-up on the undercarriages of delivery trucks does not end up in the chip flow.\n\n### Plastic Contamination\n\nPlastic is the most damaging contaminant and the most difficult to control. Plastic contamination is a significant problem in pulp manufacture; the amount of plastic in one small plastic pen can ruin 1000 tonnes of pulp. Generally, the industry has done a great job of controlling the amount of plastic used in a pulp mill.\n\nUnfortunately, most tramp plastic has similar physical characteristics to wood in that it is light and buoyant, so cannot be separated from wood by air density separation or flotation.\n\nThere is no 'magic bullet', when it comes to eliminating plastic contamination. The mill must develop and enforce a rigorous plastic control program; and even this will not guarantee complete elimination. The well-known key steps in minimizing plastic contamination are:\n\n- Keeping tramp plastic out of the wood chip supply stream into the mill is the best way to reduce plastic contamination. This requires working with your wood chip suppliers and haulers to educate them about the consequences of plastic contamination and ensuring they are taking the necessary steps to keep tramp plastic out of the chips. It is also a good idea to conduct unannounced audits of the wood supplier's facilities.\n\n- Instituting a good 'plastic is drastic' awareness program in the mill, and training everyone to be on the lookout for and picking-up tramp plastic and disposing of it properly.\n\n- Minimizing the use of plastic in the mill, particularly where it has a chance of getting into the fibre supply.\n\n- Using 'pulp-safe' plastics where plastics are required.\n\n- Generally, pulp-safe plastic is considered to have a melting point >160°C and a specific gravity >1.0.\n\n- Redwood Plastics makes a wonderful pulp-safe UHMW wearplate called 'Synsteel', that has good, low-friction anti-wear characteristics and has metal embedded in it that enables the material to be picked-up by a magnet or detected by a metal detector. Synsteel is excellent for wearplates.\n\n- Redwood also makes another plastic wearplate called SPS that dissolves in the Kraft pulping chemicals.\n\nAlso, refer to the article titled \"Rock Removal from Woody Biomass\".\n\n## 10. Dust, Gas and Fire Control\n\n### Dust Control\n\nFugitive dusting is a big problem, particularly when handling dry wood fibre. Every time that wood chips are handled, they break up into smaller particles. Very fine dust particles are easily conveyed in air currents. If not controlled, fugitive dusting will be observed at conveyor transfers, screening systems, truck and railcar dumpers and at the end of long chutes.\n\nFugitive dust is not only a housekeeping issue, but also presents an environmental hazard, health risk and fire and explosion risk. The minimum design parameters for dust control systems include:\n\n- Totally enclosing the equipment to contain the product and to give heavier dust particles time to settle out.\n- Keep the equipment under a negative pressure so that there is a net inflow of air into the equipment to contain the airborne dust within the enclosed equipment.\n- Remove dust laden air permanently from the enclosed system and utilize a dust collector to collect the dust in containers for removal from the site.\n- Do not reintroduce the dust into back the conveyor system where it would only be re-entrained at the next transfer point.\n\n### Gas Control / Monitoring\n\nDecomposing biomass produces harmful gases including CO, CO₂ and CH₄.\n\n- CO and CO₂ gas levels can be indicative of smouldering biomass, so measure and trend these gas levels when chips are stored in enclosed vessels and silos.\n- Methane (CH₄) is a product of biomass degradation, so measure and trend CH₄.\n- Ventilate enclosed spaces to evacuate harmful gases.\n- Where there is the possibility of CO, CO₂ and CH₄ generation, it is also necessary to measure O₂ levels in adjacent enclosed areas, for personnel protection.\n\n### Spark, Fire and Explosion Control\n\nWood not only burns, but the very fine dust created during handling can be very explosive under certain concentrations. So, spark, fire and explosion prevention, detection and suppression must be considered whenever handling woody materials.\n\nRefer to the article titled \"Biomass Plant Fire and Dust Explosion Control\".\n\n## 11. Inventory Management\n\nAccurately determining the amount of dry fibre in chip piles has long been problematic and even today with accurate measuring devices, reliable dry fibre measurement is not easy to obtain. People at pulp and paper mills everywhere have struggled with this problem for years. One year they will have to write-off chip inventory that appears to have disappeared; the next year they will have too much inventory.\n\nPile size and volume is measured by surveying and years ago the lack of accuracy was accepted and used to explain inventory variances. With current laser measuring instruments, volume accuracy has greatly improved and yet the estimate of actual dry fibre remaining in the pile is still not very accurate. Generally, the problem lies with not knowing the amount of compaction and the consequent density inside the pile. Without this knowledge, back-calculating tonnage is quite 'hit and miss'.\n\nMost plants utilize an arbitrary, 'rule of thumb' density conversion factor to convert from volume to tonnage. However, this will invariably lead to inventory errors. Any inventory method that is based upon volume (m³) or green tonnes (Gt) will not produce accurate results. Chip flows and inventory should be tracked using mass in bone dry tonnes (BDt) only.\n\nWhile volume can be accurately measured, there is no quick way of measuring compaction or density deep inside a pile. In fact, density varies throughout the pile and to accurately calculate the pile tonnage (BDt), you would need to have a 3D density profile and a complex algorithm to relate it to volume.\n\nDensity varies according to moisture content and degree of compaction, and moisture content will change depending upon the climate, how long the chips are stored and the amount of compaction.\n\nCompaction varies depending upon the size and depth of the pile; the type of dozer driving over it, if any; and the size of the particles in the pile. The larger and deeper the pile, the greater is the natural compaction. The density near the surface or edges will be significantly less than near the middle.\n\nBecause of their smaller tire footprint, rubber-tired vehicles compact the chips more than do tracked vehicles. Smaller particles compact differently than do larger particles, so particle segregation within a pile will result in different densities. Each pile is different and it is next to impossible to predict pile density with any accuracy based on historical data.\n\nSome studies have shown that the density deep inside a large pile can increase by 25-30% and the overall, average pile density can increase by 14-15%.\n\nInventory management and fibre tracking is discussed in greater detail in the article titled \"Biomass Pile Inventory Management\".\n\n## 12. Chip Screening and Upgrading for Quality\n\nChips as received at the pulpmill gate are not usually of a good enough quality for producing the best pulp without further upgrading. Almost all pulpmills do the following as a minimum:\n\n- Remove tramp ferrous metals with magnets.\n- Screen-out gross-oversized wood chunks, rocks and frozen lumps.\n- Screen-out and re-process oversized chips.\n- Screen-out fine particles that do not make good pulp and absorb excess pulping chemicals.\n\nAdditionally, most Kraft pulpmills have chip thickness screening (CTS) systems that:\n\n- Screen-out and re-process overthick chips to produce a uniform chip thickness.\n- Screen-out knots and other heavies that do not pulp.\n- Screen-out and limit the amount of pin chips entering the digester.\n\nSuch chip re-processing is usually done after chips have been reclaimed from the long-term storage pile and before they are conveyed to the digester chip feed bin.\n\nA description of CTS and the justifications for this amount of chip reprocessing and can be read in more detail in the article titled \"The Benefits of Chip Thickness Screening\".\n\nFor a description of different types of biomass screens and their intended use, see the article titled \"Screens for Woody Biomass\".\n\n### Chip Sampling\n\nGood chip quality control relies on proper sampling, which must be accurate and precise and must truly represent the main body of chips. Unless samples are taken properly, they will not be a true representation of the main product flow.\n\nCollecting samples of wood chips is one task in the mill that is not always done well. Tail-gate sampling is notoriously inaccurate.\n\nWithout good sampling, quality control is based on false information. Bulk materials can be difficult to sample properly on a production basis.

Introduction\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Pulpmills are among the largest users of woody biomass and typically store and process huge volumes of wood chips prior to the pulping process. Storage volumes of 120,000 BDt (750,000 m³) are not uncommon. The value of these chips is in the tens of millions of dollars, so mills have very specific requirements for storing wood chips to minimize fibre losses and maximize fibre recovery.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Things to consider when designing chip storage piles include: the material being handled, total required storage volume, practical live-storage volume, fibre aging, pile turn-over, dry fibre loss, chip degradation and breakage, dust and fire control, inventory management, the methods of pile-building and reclaiming, etc.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This article covers these topics in a general manner.

Pile Size / Storage Volume\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The mill must store enough chips in order not to inhibit pulp production; however, inventory is costly, so the mill will not want to store excessive volumes unnecessarily. Following are the parameters that affect chip storage volume and the footprint area required.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Required Throughput to Pulpmill\u003C/strong> – some mills with secure and reliable chip delivery methods operate on a ‘just-in-time’ delivery regime with a minimum of 1-4 week’s supply of chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Fibre Aging Requirement\u003C/strong> – Some pulping processes require that the wood chips be aged, sometimes up to (3) months.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Different Species\u003C/strong> – Some mills utilize different softwood (SW) or hardwood (HW) species in various blends and must keep them separate in storage. Also, they must receive the different chip species as they are produced and delivered to the mill, which often does not correspond to the time that they are actually being used for pulp.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Different Densities\u003C/strong> – Different species when chipped can have different bulk densities, so the amount of dry fibre in a given volume will vary somewhat between species.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Different Grades / Types\u003C/strong> – Some mills receive different grades or types of wood chips that must be stored separately.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Compaction\u003C/strong> – Compaction naturally occurs in all biomass piles, but can be artificially induced by mobile equipment running on top. An average of 15% compaction is not uncommon.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Dry-fibre Loss\u003C/strong> – The amount of dry fibre loss resulting from bacteriological action and oxidation varies depending upon the species, temperature, moisture content, amount of O₂ present or not present, storage time, pile shape, etc. and can be significant. Dry fibre loss cannot be avoided but should be minimized; and at the least should be provided for, particularly when accounting for inventory.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Storage Form\u003C/strong> – In some cases where wood species deteriorate rapidly in chip form and storage time is long, it would be better to store the wood in log form rather than as chips; and process the logs into chips on-site closer to the time they are required in the pulpmill.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Available Storage Space\u003C/strong> – Space is a big factor when determining pile size and shape. For example, automatic live-storage systems are not the most space efficient and generally require a large footprint, so if the required amount of storage volume is large in comparison to the space available, this might preclude or minimize the amount of live-storage. I have seen some mills with limited storage area where there is just one big pile and there is no delineation between species.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Planned Delivery Interruptions\u003C/strong> – Delivery times are often affected by climate or forest access restrictions. In northern Canada, access to the forest is sometimes limited to 100 days during the winter when the ground is frozen and to protect some animal species under the ‘species at risk’ act. In some tropical forests, access to the forest is restricted to the dry season. These predictable delivery interruptions can generally be planned around and enough chips stored to eliminate mill shutdowns due to low inventory.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Unplanned Delivery Interruptions\u003C/strong> – Sometimes other things unexpectedly stop or restrict chip delivery into the mill; for example, forest fires, labour disputes, shut down of the plants supplying residual chips, etc. These are difficult to plan for but must be considered and contingency back-up plans provided.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Contractual Requirements\u003C/strong> – Most mills have long-term purchase agreements with suppliers and must have space to be able to continue to receive wood chips, even when the pulpmill is shut down and not using chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Pile Turn-over\u003C/strong> – Space is required to manage the chip pile. To ensure an orderly pile turn-over, you do not want to be dropping fresh chips on top of old chips, unless you have a FIFO reclaim system.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"4-lifo-and-fifo-storage-piles\">4. LIFO and FIFO Storage Piles\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"last-in-first-out-lifo-storage\">Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) Storage\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Most manually built and reclaimed chip storage piles have LIFO storage, with the chips on top of the pile being used first. This leads to the situation where the newest and freshest chips are being used first and the oldest and most degraded chips are being used last. This is not an ideal situation from a fibre-loss perspective nor from a chip quality perspective, which has an effect on digester operation and throughput.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, some studies indicate that the highest rate of decay occurs in the first few days after chips have been manufactured, then tends to level out. Consequently, some theorize that if fibre-loss is your greatest concern, then fresh-cut chips should be used immediately before they have time to decay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"first-in-first-out-fifo-storage\">First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Storage\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>From a fibre degradation perspective, FIFO storage is considered to be the most desirable, as the oldest chips are used first. Additionally, the chip retention time in the pile and consequent fibre degradation for all chips remains fairly constant, which minimizes one variable affecting chip and pulp quality.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>FIFO storage is hard to achieve reliably without an automatic pile building and reclaim system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"5-live-storage--dead-storage\">5. Live-Storage / Dead Storage\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Live-storage refers to the volume of chips that is located over / under a reclaimer and that can be reclaimed automatically without operator intervention. Generally from an operating cost perspective, the more live-storage, the better.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Live-storage requires mechanical devices that reclaim the chips from the pile.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dead areas of the pile that do not have live-storage, require mobile equipment to reclaim the chips. Steel-tracked dozers and rubber-tired front-end loaders (FEL’s) are most commonly used, and have higher operating costs than do automatic reclaim systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"6-chip-degradation-and-breakage\">6. Chip Degradation and Breakage\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"biological-activity-and-oxidation\">Biological Activity and Oxidation\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Wood fibre degrades from biological activity and oxidation resulting in fibre losses. This has been well-documented in many studies. Some studies show that more than 1% of useful fibre can be lost per month of storage due to biological action and oxidation. Consequently, the mill must bring in more material to make up for this loss, which can involve substantial additional costs.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Biological action is affected by the type and species of biomass being handled, moisture content, temperature, and the amount of oxygen present. With sufficient oxygen, fibre degradation will increase as the moisture content and temperature increase.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some studies show that the losses due to oxidation are lower in highly compacted piles where the amount of oxygen is restricted. Other studies have shown that if air flow is enhanced, generated heat can be dissipated and biological action slowed down, which in turn reduces the amount of heat generated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Non-organic material in the chips is not affected by microbial action, so, as a side effect of dry fibre loss, the non-organic content rises when expressed as a percentage of the dry fibre left. Therefore, the higher the dry fibre losses, the higher the non-organic content in the chips delivered to the digester.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"breakage\">Breakage\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Every time chips are handled, they break-up into smaller pieces. Breakage occurs at truck dumpers, in chain conveyors, at belt conveyor transfers, and in screening systems. The greatest amount of chip breakage occurs in pneumatic conveyors and from mobile equipment driving on chip piles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Studies have shown that significantly higher breakage occurs from rubber-tired vehicles driving over chips than from steel-tracked vehicles, primarily from the smaller footprint and higher pressures.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"particle-size\">Particle Size\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Particle size within a biomass pile has a big effect on moisture absorption, heat build-up / dissipation and dry fibre losses. Piles containing a large amount of fines absorb greater amounts of water, generally heat up faster due to greater microbial action, and restrict air movement through the pile, thereby limiting heat dissipation; all of this leading to increased dry fibre loss and possibly spontaneous combustion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Conversely, piles consisting of large wood chunks heat up more slowly, permit better air flow due to the large voids, dissipate the heat faster due to better air circulation, have lower rates of microbial action and lower dry fibre losses.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Regular chip sampling is necessary to ensure the incoming material meets contractual requirements and also to ensure that the chips being fed to the digester meet the proper size distribution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also refer to the article titled “Biomass Storage Pile Basics”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"7-pile-reclaiming-methods\">7. Pile Reclaiming Methods\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are many storage and reclaim systems available and each has its place. Choosing the right system depends upon: the material being handled; the total amount of storage required; the amount of live-storage required; the need or not for first-in / first-out flow; the ability to accurately meter chips; the need for mixing / blending; and whether covered storage is required or not.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Generally, fully automatic systems with 100% live-storage are prohibitively costly and most projects that I have been involved in, end up with something significantly less than 100% live-storage, usually with enough for a few hours of operation with no operator intervention.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are many different types of reclaimers, including:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Under-pile chain reclaimers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Under-pile screw reclaimers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Over-pile chain reclaimers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Over-pile ‘scratcher’ reclaimers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Under-pile vibrating floor reclaimers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Under-pile ‘shuffle-floor’ reclaimers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Under-pile stoker reclaimers\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Moving-Hole reclaimers\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"under-pile-chain-reclaimers\">Under-pile Chain Reclaimers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Under-pile chain reclaimers consist of multiple strands of drag chain lining the bottom of a receiving hopper, over which the storage pile is built. The receiving hopper is equipped with a metering gate at the opening and the live-bottom chains are usually equipped with variable speed drives for varying the amount of chips metered from the hopper. Under-pile chain reclaimers are generally the most common type of reclaimer and have the lowest capital cost. Unfortunately, they have the smallest live-storage capacity and tend to bridge.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"under-pile-screw-reclaimers\">Under-pile Screw Reclaimers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The rotary, under-pile screw reclaimer consists of a tapered, variable pitch, variable speed screw slewing about a central point. The screw draws the material from the bottom of the pile to the center pivot point where it discharges through an opening into a conveyor located below. Rotary, under-pile screw reclaimers work well and do a good job of mixing but are fairly costly. Live-storage quantities are limited to 12-24 hours.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Traveling, under-pile screw reclaimers have screws similar to the rotary, under-pile screw; but the screws are mounted on a carriage, which traverses on a set of rails along one side of the chip pile. The traveling screw removes material from the bottom of the pile and discharges it into a belt conveyor traveling along one edge of the pile. Traveling, under-pile, screw reclaimers work well, do a good job of mixing and can have a large live-storage volume of many days. Unfortunately, they are very costly and require a large footprint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because they are cutting across the bottom of the pile, under-pile chain reclaimers do a good job of FIFO reclaiming and mixing material from striated piles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Under-pile screw reclaimers require high HP drives and cause chip damage due to the shearing action between the rotating screw and the chips sitting above the screw.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"over-pile-chain-reclaimers\">Over-pile Chain Reclaimers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Over-pile chain reclaimers are used to reclaim material from longitudinal or circular conical piles. They consist of a dual strand chain, flight conveyor that is mounted on a luffing boom. The boom is lowered onto the top of the pile and the chain conveyor drags material off the pile into a conveyor system. The chain conveyor traverses longitudinally back-and-forth along the top of the pile, taking nominal cuts off the surface of the pile. After reclaiming a section of the storage pile, the reclaimer is re-positioned to another section of the pile. Limited FIFO is possible.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The rotary, over-pile chain reclaimer is usually mounted on and rotates about a central column, and is often mated with a circular stacker conveyor which is mounted on and rotates about the same column. Depending upon the required chip throughput and the size of the reclaimer, rotary, over-pile chain reclaimers can have live-storage of several days.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The longitudinal, over-pile chain reclaimer is mounted on a travelling carriage which traverses along rails, and is usually mated with a separate longitudinal belt stacker. Longitudinal conical piles can be quite long and therefore can contain a much greater quantity of chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Depending upon their design, over-pile chain reclaimers can provide >80% live-storage. But, they are much more costly than under-pile chain reclaimers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As they are being constructed, most conical piles tend to concentrate the fines in the center and top of the pile while the larger particles roll to the outside edge. Consequently, the average particle size of the material being reclaimed by an over-pile chain reclaimer can vary considerably, depending upon where the reclaimer is operating within the pile.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"over-pile-scratcher-reclaimers\">Over-pile Scratcher Reclaimers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This type of reclaimer consists of a large frame with rake teeth that is lowered onto the inclined surface of a circular, conical pile. The frame oscillates back-and-forth on the pile causing the chips to trickle down the face of the pile. When they reach the bottom edge of the pile, the chips are swept-up by a chain conveyor, which moves the chips to the conveyor system. The over-pile scratcher reclaimer is usually mated with and follows a stacker conveyor, which builds the pile ahead of the reclaimer. This stacker / reclaimer combination gives true FIFO.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"under-pile-vibrating-floor-reclaimers\">Under-pile Vibrating Floor Reclaimers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>There are several makes of under-pile vibrating floor reclaimers, but they all rely on a declining vibrating pan that moves the chips along to a conveyor, when the pan vibrates. They are almost always used under silos or bins, not in open piles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"shuffle-floor-reclaimers\">Shuffle-Floor Reclaimers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Live-bottom, ‘shuffle-floors’ are sometimes used as reclaimers in the bottom of bins.

The ladders stroke back-and-forth and the ladder rungs pull the material from the bottom of the pile forward to a conveyor system. Ladder-stoker reclaimers have been available for decades, are quite reliable and are most often used when handling wastewood hog fuel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"moving-hole-reclaimers\">Moving-Hole Reclaimers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>When mated with a mass-flow bin, the ‘moving-hole’ reclaimer does an excellent job of reclaiming difficult-to-handle materials with poor flow characteristics, as it does not impart compression forces into the material above the reclaimer. For a description of the ‘moving-hole’ concept go to the Kamengo website. \u003Ca href=\"http://www.kamengo.com/\">http://www.kamengo.com/\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"8-pile-building-methods\">8. Pile Building Methods\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Pile building can be accomplished by mobile equipment, over-pile belt or chain conveyors, slewing / luffing stackers, or pneumatic conveyors. The type of pile builder is often dictated by the type of reclaimer.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"mobile-equipment\">Mobile Equipment\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Chips are conveyed to and dropped onto a chip storage pad. Either a rubber-tired, front-end loader (FEL) or a tracked ‘dozer’ is used to push the chips away from the drop point and push them up into a pile. The same mobile equipment is often used for reclaiming the chips from the pile(s) and pushing them into a live-bottom reclaimer, which meters the chips into a conveyor system to the chip screening system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"over-pile-belt-outstocking-conveyor\">Over-Pile Belt Outstocking Conveyor\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This type of pile builder utilizes a belt conveyor that passes over the top of the chip storage pad. The belt conveyor is housed inside a gallery that is suspended between concrete pylons. The belt conveyor discharges chips through multiple plows or fixed trippers onto the chip pad below. Occasionally, a traveling tripper is used to build a continuous, conical pile. Sometimes, telescopic chutes are used under the drop points to minimize dusting. Chain conveyors are sometimes used as outstocking conveyors over short piles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"chip-flingers\">Chip Flingers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Chip flingers are often used under conveyor drop points for spreading the chips across the top of the pile. Flingers consist of a short, high-speed belt (4,000 fpm) that can luff and slew to distribute the chips up to a 140’ radius from the drop point. Chip flingers are notorious for producing particle segregation in the chip piles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"stacker-conveyors\">Stacker Conveyors\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Stacker conveyors can build either a longitudinal conical pile or a circular conical pile. They consist of a luffing belt conveyor mounted on a cantilevered truss. Material is fed onto the lower end of the conveyor and discharged over the cantilevered end onto the pile.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Longitudinal stackers are mounted on travelling carriages which traverse along rails. The circular stacker is mounted on and rotates (slews) about a central column. The circular stacker is most often married to a circular over-pile chain reclaimer, which is mounted to and rotates about the same central column.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"pneumatic-stackers\">Pneumatic Stackers\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Pneumatic conveyors are rarely used for transporting pulp chips because they cause significant chip damage and have high power requirements. However, there are a few still in use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pneumatic stackers can be simple, fixed pipes blowing chips onto a pile, or they can be equipped with cyclones mounted on carriages that slew about a central point and build conical piles.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"equipment-sizing\">Equipment Sizing\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The type of outstocking / pile building method selected must be able to handle the maximum flow being delivered to it. For example, the flow rate from a chip truck dumper is usually much higher than the overall average chip flow to the pile.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"9-contamination-issues\">9. Contamination Issues\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Assume that the incoming raw material will be contaminated, possibly with dirt, rocks, grit and metal, and snow and ice in northern climates; the amounts of which should be minimized prior to the chips being introduced into the digester chip bin, as they can cause damage to the downstream brownstock equipment and degrade pulp quality and production.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ferrous metal is relatively easy to remove with self-cleaning magnets, but to be effective, care must be taken with magnet placement and orientation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Large rocks and frozen lumps can be removed with disc scalping screens.

Inventory Management\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Accurately determining the amount of dry fibre in chip piles has long been problematic and even today with accurate measuring devices, reliable dry fibre measurement is not easy to obtain. People at pulp and paper mills everywhere have struggled with this problem for years. One year they will have to write-off chip inventory that appears to have disappeared; the next year they will have too much inventory.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pile size and volume is measured by surveying and years ago the lack of accuracy was accepted and used to explain inventory variances. With current laser measuring instruments, volume accuracy has greatly improved and yet the estimate of actual dry fibre remaining in the pile is still not very accurate. Generally, the problem lies with not knowing the amount of compaction and the consequent density inside the pile. Without this knowledge, back-calculating tonnage is quite ‘hit and miss’.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most plants utilize an arbitrary, ‘rule of thumb’ density conversion factor to convert from volume to tonnage. However, this will invariably lead to inventory errors. Any inventory method that is based upon volume (m³) or green tonnes (Gt) will not produce accurate results. Chip flows and inventory should be tracked using mass in bone dry tonnes (BDt) only.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While volume can be accurately measured, there is no quick way of measuring compaction or density deep inside a pile. In fact, density varies throughout the pile and to accurately calculate the pile tonnage (BDt), you would need to have a 3D density profile and a complex algorithm to relate it to volume.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Density varies according to moisture content and degree of compaction, and moisture content will change depending upon the climate, how long the chips are stored and the amount of compaction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Compaction varies depending upon the size and depth of the pile; the type of dozer driving over it, if any; and the size of the particles in the pile. The larger and deeper the pile, the greater is the natural compaction. The density near the surface or edges will be significantly less than near the middle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because of their smaller tire footprint, rubber-tired vehicles compact the chips more than do tracked vehicles. Smaller particles compact differently than do larger particles, so particle segregation within a pile will result in different densities. Each pile is different and it is next to impossible to predict pile density with any accuracy based on historical data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some studies have shown that the density deep inside a large pile can increase by 25-30% and the overall, average pile density can increase by 14-15%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Inventory management and fibre tracking is discussed in greater detail in the article titled “Biomass Pile Inventory Management”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"12-chip-screening-and-upgrading-for-quality\">12.

There are many organizations that dictate safety requirements and provide guidelines for guarding, and it can be confusing as to which organization has authority. The end-user must know which apply in his area.\n\nThis article provides general instructions as to where information can be found regarding WorkSafe and OHSA requirements with regards to conveyors in BC, AB and ON. Also included are comments regarding general conveyor safety and guarding experience that the author has gained over the years.\n\n## Regulations and Standards\n\nIn BC, equipment guarding must meet the requirements of WorkSafe BC's, OHS Regulation Part 12 \"Tools, Machinery and Equipment\", which references CSA Standard Z432-94 \"Safeguarding of Machinery\" (Note: a new version, Z432-16 is available). Another referenced document is ANSI / ASME Standard B20.1-1993 \"Safety Standard for Conveyors and Related Equipment\" (Note: a newer version, B20.1-2012 is available).\n\nIn Alberta, Workplace Health & Safety has a guide titled \"Best Practices on Conveyor Safety\" that also references CSA Z432-94 and provides an excellent set of guidelines suggesting practical ways that the standard can be met.\n\nIn Ontario, the OHSA also references CSA Standard Z432-94. Ontario also provides a useful document titled \"Guidelines for Pre-Start Health and Safety Reviews\".\n\nCSA Standard Z432-16 has a good section titled \"5 Risk Assessment\", that describes the purpose, required stakeholders, scope and methodology for assessing machine risk. A Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) is a great arena for identifying risk areas that need guarding. Z432, Section 5 talks about shared responsibility between the equipment manufacturer and the end-user, but states \"When the manufacturer (or the manufacturer's representative) does not provide a risk assessment for the machine, the user shall assume this responsibility.\" So in the end, the responsibility for the risk assessment and guarding implementation falls on the end-user.\n\nCSA Z1000, Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems provides guidance to organizations by addressing the various facets of occupational health and safety.\n\n## Interpretation\n\nThe above regulations and standards provide instructions as to where guarding is required, and what the guarding is to achieve. But, they don't give instructions as to how the guarding is to be designed or constructed. Often, the requirements appear to be contradictory, or have the unintended effect of impeding other operations such as maintenance or housekeeping. So while the regulations are firm, their implementation is sometimes open to interpretation.\n\nAn engineer can do his best to interpret the regulations and design a suitable guard, and the local safety inspector can come along, not like what he sees and want something different. Inspectors who come out of the nuclear, oil and gas, mining or smelting industries can have a much stricter interpretation than one with a forest products industry background.\n\nAdditionally today with the emphasis on zero-harm, sometimes what has been standard for decades is no longer acceptable. A good case in point is the request to provide guarding full-length along belt conveyor carrying and return idlers.\n\nWSBC Part 12 doesn't have much to say on belt conveyors. Section 12.23 states \"A belt conveyor must have accessible nip points of spools and pulleys guarded to prevent contact by a worker.\" And, section 12.22 states \"Unless otherwise permitted by this Regulation, a conveyor must meet the requirements of ANSI Standard ANSI/ASME B20.1-1993,Safety Standards for Conveyors and Related Equipment\".\n\nANSI B20.1 requires guarding at belt conveyor pulley nip points, take-ups, carrying idlers under skirtboards, accessible return idlers, and accessible return and carrying idlers in convex curves [paraphrased].\n\n*Figure 1 – Belt Conveyor with Full-length Belt and Idler Guards*\n\nANSI B20.1, 6.1.1 (b) also states \"It is not the intent of this requirement to provide guarding along the conveyor length where the belt rides on the carrying or return rollers.\" In spite of this, on recent projects some safety inspectors have required companies to install guarding full-length along the conveyors to prevent access to all carrying and return idlers within reach of a person on the ground, platform or walkway.\n\n## FM Global\n\nWoody biomass is very dusty and is susceptible to fire and dust explosions. Your plant insurer will have asset and personnel protection requirements regarding the design, construction and operation of conveyors. FM Global provides the following Property Loss Prevention Data Sheets that are worthy of consideration.\n\n- FMDS 7-10: Wood Processing and Woodworking Facilities\n- FMDS 7-11: Belt Conveyors\n\n## NFPA\n\nNFPA 101, Life Safety Code provides guidelines for fire protection and egress that are relevant to conveyors, particularly special structures such as underground conveyor tunnels or conveyor galleries.\n\n## Equipment Manufacturers\n\nEquipment manufacturers are required to provide integral safety guards as part of their equipment supply. Each jurisdiction has its own safety guarding requirements, so it is necessary to make the equipment supplier aware of the appropriate governing regulations.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\nThe following general guidelines should be included in every technical specification and construction contract.\n\n1. Equipment guards shall be provided as indicated in each equipment specification.\n\n2. The equipment and guards shall comply with the WorkSafe / OHSA regulations that are in effect for the end-user's jurisdiction, including: \u003Cand provide a list>.\n\n3. Equipment guards shall be supplied by the vendor and shall have the following features and accessories:\n\n   - Be made in sections that can easily be handled by one person. (Most jurisdictions specify a maximum weight.)\n   - Be easily removable and fastened with stainless steel bolts.\n   - Be designed to accommodate housekeeping, maintenance and lubrication.\n\n4. The equipment and guards shall be supplied complete with industry standard safety labels per ANSI Z535 and CEMA.\n\n5. The paint colour for guards, handrails, ladders and cages shall be Safety Yellow, \u003Cor sometimes Alert Orange>.\n\n## Engineering\n\nWhen designing conveyors, engineers must consider safety and guarding. In the past, most engineering companies developed their own standards and guidelines for designing and constructing guards. Often, these standards were subsequently adopted by the engineer's client companies. So, when starting on a design project, confirm the specific guarding requirements with your client.\n\nThe tendency today is to quote the appropriate regulations in the equipment supply technical specifications and require the conveyor manufacturer to design and provide the guards. The problems with this approach are:\n\n- A 'mish-mash' of guard styles and construction are delivered from the different equipment manufacturers.\n- Often the guarding arrives at site doesn't fit properly and must be modified, which is not difficult if it is a simple wire mesh guard, but can be a big problem if it's a sealed oil chain guard or is made from stainless or aluminum.\n\nMy preference is to have a knowledgeable sheet metal company that specializes in guard construction, construct the guards after the equipment has been installed, when accurate measurements can be taken. The guard contractor would be provided with instructions as to where the guards are required, general guard design guidelines, and the appropriate WorkSafe / OHSA requirements, CSA and ANSI standards. Additionally, the contractor would consult with the end-user to get his requirements prior to fabrication.\n\n## Retrofit Projects\n\nWhere a mill is instructed to add guarding to existing conveyors, it is best to engage the safety inspector who has requested the change and get a clear understanding of his requirements, particularly if his instructions appear to contradict a code requirement. Then use an engineer / designer who is familiar with conveyors and your production process, and the maintenance, house-keeping and operational requirements. You want a guard that is safe, but has provisions for clean-up, maintenance and normal operation activities. New guards could result in new safety procedures. Once a preliminary design has been determined, try to get buy-in from the safety inspector before constructing and installing the guards. A HAZOP would likely be a good idea, too, to ensure that the new guarding hasn't resulted in new hazards, and to get buy-in from the various stakeholders.\n\nOn a recent brownfield project, the client's in-house safety inspector, who came from a smelting background, required all moving equipment in a 40-year old plant to be completely enclosed by mesh guards. The result was great for safety, but greatly inhibited the operation, clean-up and maintenance.\n\n## Control Devices\n\nMost control devices are in place to provide process control; however, it can be argued that any device that provides for smooth process operation and control, prevents process upsets, thereby enhancing safety as the necessity for operators and maintenance people to go into the equipment area to correct an upset condition, is greatly reduced.\n\nCommon control devices used in various types of conveying systems include:\n\n- Level control sensors – solids and liquids\n- Plugged-chute switches\n- Speed sensors / switches\n- Safety pullcord switches – pre-tensioned type\n- Position / limit switches\n- Misalignment switches\n- Broken chain switches\n- Pressure sensors / switches\n- Temperature sensors / switches\n- Smoke detectors\n- Spark / flame detectors\n- Explosion detectors\n- Gas sensors\n\nOf course to be effective and safe, these components must be properly applied, installed, maintained and operated.\n\n## Drive Guards\n\nTypical equipment drive guards include:\n\n- Coupling guards\n- Shaft guards\n- Roller chain guards\n- V-belt / cogged-belt drive guards\n\n## Belt Conveyor Guards\n\nGuards commonly used on belt conveyors include:\n\n- Drive guards\n- Head chute covering the head pulley and discharge chute opening\n- Nip points at all exposed pulley / shaft assemblies including: drive-shaft, tail-shaft, take-up shaft, tripper shafts, bend shafts and snub shafts.\n- Nip points at all carrying and return idlers in convex curves.\n- Nip points at all carrying idlers under skirtboards.\n- Other carry-idler guards – per safety inspector's requirements.\n- Nip guards at all return idlers below 8' above the ground, walkways and platforms.\n- Return idler retaining guards (can double as nip guards)\n- Gravity take-up (GTU) counterweight guards\n- Guards at plows and return belt cleaners\n- Speed-switch guards\n- Slide-gate and flop-gate guards\n- Magnet guards\n- Telescopic chute winches and wires\n- Conveyor hoods often provide guarding of the carrying belt and idlers.\n- Wire mesh guards in bottoms of elevated galleries – to catch idlers, etc.\n\n## Chain Conveyor Guards\n\nChain conveyors are often totally enclosed, but at the least would require the following guards:\n\n- Drive guards\n- Return chain-strand guards\n- Nip point guards at all exposed shaft assemblies\n- Speed-switch guards\n- Slide-gate, flop-gate guards\n\n## Bucket Elevator, Screw Conveyor and Pneumatic Conveyor Guards\n\n- Usually totally enclosed\n- Drive guards\n- Speed-switch guards\n- Slide-gate, flop-gate guards\n- Additionally, screw conveyors must have screened mesh inside inspection doors.\n\n## Handrails\n\n*Figure 2 – Handrail Restricting Access to Chain Conveyor Return Strand*\n\nHandrails are often used to limit access into restricted areas or around moving equipment such as:\n\n- Moving trippers\n- Moving chip flingers\n- Winches and wire ropes\n- Gyratory or vibratory screens\n- Truck dumpers\n- Pneumatic conveyor switching valves, 'wig-wag' loaders\n- Stoker ladder actuators\n- In-floor or below-grade conveyors\n- Areas near deflagration vents\n- Open pits\n\nHandrails with kickplates are required along all conveyor galleries and walkways and must be constructed to the appropriate regulations.\n\n## Conveyor Walkways\n\nConveyor walkways should be constructed from safety-grip bar grating, or be painted with non-slip paint. Extra-steep walkways are difficult to walk up and down, and should be constructed in a stair fashion.\n\nMost jurisdictions require walkways with a minimum clearance of 36″, which often is difficult to achieve, particularly in narrow conveyor galleries.\n\n## Egress from Special Structures\n\nEgress from special structures such as elevated conveyor galleries or underground tunnels requires special consideration. Nominally, the National Fire Code specifies a maximum distance to an egress point of 100′, but this can be extended to 150′, if a sprinkler system is present. Also, the maximum 'dead-end' distance in a conveyor gallery is 50′ from an egress point.\n\nConveyor galleries over chip piles present unique challenges for egress. Egress ladders can be installed on support pylons, but the pylons are often buried in wood chips, and the ladders are easily damaged by the mobile chip dozers, which are used for reclaiming the chips. Normally, egress ladders would have safety cages, but these will fill with chips and block egress.\n\nLikewise, egress points are difficult to provide for conveyor tunnels underneath chip piles.\n\nIf the client already has galleries over storage piles, or tunnels under storage piles, it is best to check with the client to determine how he has addressed these issues. You may want to approach the local safety inspector, too.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nGuards are sometimes used to contain material and to protect personnel and equipment from material falling off of or being thrown out of a conveyor. eg. – to contain logs at the debarking drum feed and discharge conveyors.\n\n## Equipment Lock-Out\n\nEquipment must be de-energized and 'locked-out' before personnel enter hazardous areas for any reason, including housekeeping, maintenance or operational activities.\n\nEquipment de-energization includes disconnecting electrical power and releasing or physically securing stored mechanical / hydraulic energy.\n\nEquipment lock-out requires that personnel apply keyed locks to equipment power sources, valves, doors, etc. to ensure that equipment cannot be operated, before working on the equipment.\n\nThere are strict requirements governing de-energization and locking-out activities. Refer to WorkSafe BC OHS Regulation Part 10 \"De-energization and Lockout\".\n\n## Hazardous Locations Classifications\n\nElectrical equipment can cause fires and explosions in certain atmospheres, including dusty wood and biomass handling areas. Areas are designated by class, divisions and groups specifying the relevant hazards and describing the conditions for each designation.\n\nEach piece of electrical equipment must be specified as being suitable for use in a particular designated area.\n\nFor a description of the various classes, divisions and groups refer to NFPA 70, Article 500, \"Hazardous (Classified) Locations, Classes I, II, III, Divisions 1 and 2\".\n\n## Dust Control and Asset Protection\n\nDust control and asset protection relate to conveyor safety and should be considered when designing conveyor systems.

There are many organizations that dictate safety requirements and provide guidelines for guarding, and it can be confusing as to which organization has authority. The end-user must know which apply in his area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This article provides general instructions as to where information can be found regarding WorkSafe and OHSA requirements with regards to conveyors in BC, AB and ON. Also included are comments regarding general conveyor safety and guarding experience that the author has gained over the years.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"regulations-and-standards\">Regulations and Standards\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In BC, equipment guarding must meet the requirements of WorkSafe BC’s, OHS Regulation Part 12 “Tools, Machinery and Equipment”, which references CSA Standard Z432-94 “Safeguarding of Machinery” (Note: a new version, Z432-16 is available). Another referenced document is ANSI / ASME Standard B20.1-1993 “Safety Standard for Conveyors and Related Equipment” (Note: a newer version, B20.1-2012 is available).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In Alberta, Workplace Health &#x26; Safety has a guide titled “Best Practices on Conveyor Safety” that also references CSA Z432-94 and provides an excellent set of guidelines suggesting practical ways that the standard can be met.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In Ontario, the OHSA also references CSA Standard Z432-94. Ontario also provides a useful document titled “Guidelines for Pre-Start Health and Safety Reviews”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>CSA Standard Z432-16 has a good section titled “5 Risk Assessment”, that describes the purpose, required stakeholders, scope and methodology for assessing machine risk. A Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) is a great arena for identifying risk areas that need guarding. Z432, Section 5 talks about shared responsibility between the equipment manufacturer and the end-user, but states “When the manufacturer (or the manufacturer’s representative) does not provide a risk assessment for the machine, the user shall assume this responsibility.” So in the end, the responsibility for the risk assessment and guarding implementation falls on the end-user.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>CSA Z1000, Occupational Health &#x26; Safety Management Systems provides guidance to organizations by addressing the various facets of occupational health and safety.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"interpretation\">Interpretation\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The above regulations and standards provide instructions as to where guarding is required, and what the guarding is to achieve. But, they don’t give instructions as to how the guarding is to be designed or constructed. Often, the requirements appear to be contradictory, or have the unintended effect of impeding other operations such as maintenance or housekeeping. So while the regulations are firm, their implementation is sometimes open to interpretation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An engineer can do his best to interpret the regulations and design a suitable guard, and the local safety inspector can come along, not like what he sees and want something different. Inspectors who come out of the nuclear, oil and gas, mining or smelting industries can have a much stricter interpretation than one with a forest products industry background.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Additionally today with the emphasis on zero-harm, sometimes what has been standard for decades is no longer acceptable. A good case in point is the request to provide guarding full-length along belt conveyor carrying and return idlers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>WSBC Part 12 doesn’t have much to say on belt conveyors. Section 12.23 states “A belt conveyor must have accessible nip points of spools and pulleys guarded to prevent contact by a worker.” And, section 12.22 states “Unless otherwise permitted by this Regulation, a conveyor must meet the requirements of ANSI Standard ANSI/ASME B20.1-1993,Safety Standards for Conveyors and Related Equipment”.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>ANSI B20.1 requires guarding at belt conveyor pulley nip points, take-ups, carrying idlers under skirtboards, accessible return idlers, and accessible return and carrying idlers in convex curves [paraphrased].\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Figure 1 – Belt Conveyor with Full-length Belt and Idler Guards\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>ANSI B20.1, 6.1.1 (b) also states “It is not the intent of this requirement to provide guarding along the conveyor length where the belt rides on the carrying or return rollers.” In spite of this, on recent projects some safety inspectors have required companies to install guarding full-length along the conveyors to prevent access to all carrying and return idlers within reach of a person on the ground, platform or walkway.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"fm-global\">FM Global\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Woody biomass is very dusty and is susceptible to fire and dust explosions.

In the past, most engineering companies developed their own standards and guidelines for designing and constructing guards. Often, these standards were subsequently adopted by the engineer’s client companies. So, when starting on a design project, confirm the specific guarding requirements with your client.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The tendency today is to quote the appropriate regulations in the equipment supply technical specifications and require the conveyor manufacturer to design and provide the guards.

The guard contractor would be provided with instructions as to where the guards are required, general guard design guidelines, and the appropriate WorkSafe / OHSA requirements, CSA and ANSI standards. Additionally, the contractor would consult with the end-user to get his requirements prior to fabrication.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"retrofit-projects\">Retrofit Projects\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Where a mill is instructed to add guarding to existing conveyors, it is best to engage the safety inspector who has requested the change and get a clear understanding of his requirements, particularly if his instructions appear to contradict a code requirement. Then use an engineer / designer who is familiar with conveyors and your production process, and the maintenance, house-keeping and operational requirements. You want a guard that is safe, but has provisions for clean-up, maintenance and normal operation activities. New guards could result in new safety procedures. Once a preliminary design has been determined, try to get buy-in from the safety inspector before constructing and installing the guards.

Accurate volume measurement is relatively easy, but to determine the amount of dry fibre actually present, the compacted density and moisture content are required. In fact, the greatest number of queries I receive at this website are with regard to biomass pile density and compaction. This is because compaction is the most difficult pile parameter to determine with any consistent accuracy.\n\nBiomass is highly compressible both through artificial and natural means. Every material is different and every pile is different. The amount of compaction depends upon the species, the form of the material, the relative amounts of bark, wood and foliage present, the grind size, particle size distribution, moisture content, weather conditions, the shape of the pile, how the pile is constructed, how long it has been sitting, the amount of decomposition, the amount of contamination with dirt, grit or stones, etc. So, it is just an educated guess as to how much compaction there will be in any one pile.\n\nTo my knowledge, there are no tables you can consult that will help you determine the amount of compaction, the average density and the consequent amount of material in any biomass pile. It is something that must be determined by a combination of measurement, calculation and over time, historical record.\n\nIf you are not artificially compacting the pile by driving on it with mobile equipment or using another form of densifier, most of the resulting compaction will likely occur as the pile is being constructed; the material at the bottom will be compressed by the weight of the material resting on top. Also, over time you will get some consolidation and decomposition which further reduces pile volume. Natural compaction in a biomass pile varies within the pile depending upon the height of the pile, with the least dense material on top and the most dense on the bottom of the pile.\n\nWith a bit of work you can approximate the average amount of compaction in small, naturally compacted biomass piles.\n\n## Method 1\n\n- Create a test pile that has a representative cross-section of your normal storage piles.\n- Measure the pile immediately after it is created and calculate the volume.\n- Measure the pile after (1) week and calculate the volume.\n- Measure the pile after (X) weeks and calculate the volume.\n- Compare the results to determine relative compaction over time.\n- To make volume calculation easier, I suggest that you create the pile between vertical walls 12'-15′ apart to make the total volume you are measuring, smaller and easier to handle.\n\n## Method 2\n\nIf the above method is not practical, you could simulate and estimate the compaction by the following method:\n\n- Determine the average bulk density of freshly ground material taken from the top surface of the pile by filling a 1.0ft³ container with material and weighing it. Take (10) different samples from different areas on the pile and calculate an average bulk density (e.g. 20 lb/ft³).\n\n- Multiply the average bulk density by the pile height to determine the load seen by the material at the bottom (e.g. 12' h x 20 lb/ft³ = 240 lb/ft²).\n\n- Place 1.0 ft³ (12 x 12 x 12 in) of freshly ground material in a container and place the equivalent weight on top (240 lb), which will compact the material somewhat.\n\n- Remove the weight and measure the new height of the compacted material and calculate the volumetric compaction (%).\n\n- Repeat steps 2-4 for each foot of pile height.\n\n- If the stockpile has a tapered top, then repeat this sequence for every foot of width of the pile, using the relative pile height in the calculation.\n\n- Calculate the average of the compaction calculations.\n\n- To determine the amount of natural compaction occurring over time, repeat steps 1-6 for: a freshly ground pile, a 1-week old pile and for an (x)-week old pile and compare the results.\n\n- You could use the same process to compare compaction values for piles of different grind sizes or materials.\n\n**Note:** Neither of these methods are suitable for determining the compaction of artificially compacted biomass piles.\n\n## Compaction Calculation Spreadsheet\n\nI have developed an Excel spreadsheet based on method 2 to approximate the natural compaction of a small biomass pile.

It consists of a series of driven shaft assemblies mounted in a frame. Each rotor shaft assembly has profiled discs mounted at regular spacings. The discs from one shaft interleaf with those on the adjacent shafts, creating open areas between the discs and the shafts.\n\nIncoming material is fed onto one end of the screen. The shaft assemblies rotate, and the discs agitate the material. Pieces of material that are smaller than the spacing between the discs and shaft assemblies fall through the screen. The pieces that are larger than the openings are conveyed along the top of the discs and pass over the end of the screen.\n\nDisc screens are particularly useful for screening biomass for the following reasons:\n\n- They provide good agitation, which is necessary for separating the biomass particles which tend to knit together.\n- They are designed to handle rocks and other large, heavy contaminants without damage.\n- They will withstand a lot of wear from abrasion.\n\n## Applications\n\nDisc Screens can be used for:\n\n- **Scalping screens**, where the object is to remove oversized material from the product flow. The oversized reject material passes over the end of the screen and the acceptable sized material passes through the screen.\n\n- **Unloading screens**, where the object is to remove undersized material from the product flow before a downstream process; the undersized reject material passes through the screen and the acceptable sized material passes over the end of the screen.\n\n- **Thickness screens**, where a precise material thickness is required.\n\nThere are many disc screen manufacturers and many styles of screens. The purpose of this article is to provide some general design fundamentals. The paper focuses on the scalping screen application, but many of the comments are applicable to all disc screens. Disc screen design is more of an art based on experience than on science.\n\n## Disc Screen Sizing\n\nDisc screen size is determined by:\n\n- The volume of incoming material. The screen must accommodate both average flow and surges.\n- Particle size distribution (PSD); that is, how much material is smaller or larger than the required product size and the percentage of each.\n- Required product size; e.g. – the required size is specified as 90-95% \u003C4\"\n\n## Disc Screen Capacity\n\nDisc screen capacity depends upon the amount (%) of screen open area, which is defined by establishing:\n\n- The number of rotor shaft assemblies\n- The disc Interface Opening (IFO)\n- The screen Slot Length\n- The disc thickness\n- The spacer collar diameter\n- Screen width and length\n- Rotor speed\n\nThe amount of screen open area has an effect on the total screen footprint; the smaller the percentage of open area, the larger the screen footprint must be for any given screen throughput.\n\n## Quantity of Rotor Shaft Assemblies\n\nThe number of shaft assemblies defines the length of the screen and depends upon the length of time required for all undersized material to percolate down through the material bed and pass through the screen. The determining factors are:\n\n- Width of the screen\n- How well the material is spread across the width of the screen\n- The cohesiveness of the material being handled\n- The amount of undersized material in the flow\n- The maximum possible surge flow\n\nDisc screens should be sized such that under the maximum possible flow conditions, all the undersized material has passed through the screen with at least 1-2 rotors clear at the end of the screen.\n\n## Slot Length and Disc IFO\n\nDisc screen openings have two dimensions (slot length and IFO). Theoretically, the maximum sized piece that can pass through a scalping screen is one that has the dimensions of the IFO and slot length and is of an infinite length. Practically speaking, if screens are fed properly such that long pieces are not allowed to fall end-wise onto and through the screen, the maximum piece passing through a screen will be a little bit longer than twice the slot length. Hence it is desirable to keep the slot length as short as possible in order to reduce the size of the longest piece passing through the screen.\n\nSlot length is the distance between adjacent shaft assembly spacer collars and is determined by:\n\n- Rotor spacing\n- Spacer collar diameter\n- Disc diameter and clearance between tip of one disc and collar of adjacent shaft\n\nThe disc Interface Opening (IFO) is defined as the spacing between interleafed discs on adjacent shaft assemblies. Generally, it has been learned from experience that the disc interface opening (IFO) should be somewhat smaller than the target product size; e.g. – IFO = \u003C3″ for a target size of \u003C4″.\n\nScreens may have one or more disc IFO's. It is advisable that the first 2 – 3 rotors to be sliver orientation rotors, which have a narrow IFO of \u003C ¾\", the idea being to encourage long pieces of wood to lie down on the screen and to prevent them from diving through the screen.\n\nIn some screening applications, multiple size classifications may be required where fine material is removed in the first part of the screen and larger fractions in the middle and last screen sections.\n\nDisc IFO and screen width dictates the number of discs required on each shaft assembly.\n\nIFO is fairly easy to change, so when selecting a screen, the most attention is paid to getting the correct IFO in order to get the correct product sizing. As noted above, slot-length is determined by the basic machine design. However, paying attention to the slot-length is important, too, when selecting a screen. Slot-length is particularly important when selecting screens that are screening small material.\n\n## Rotor Spacings\n\nThe minimum rotor spacing is usually limited by the space required to accommodate shaft assembly bearings or the inter-rotor drive components. The rotor spacing must match the actual inter-rotor drive roller chain or cogged belt sprocket center distance precisely in order to maintain a tight drive. Roller chain drives should have oil lubrication to reduce wear.\n\n## Rotor Discs\n\nThe rotor discs are mounted at pre-determined spacings on the disc shaft. The discs can be clamped between spacers or permanently fixed to the shaft by welding. The lowest cost screens use welded discs, but when the discs have worn out the entire shaft assembly must be discarded and replaced. Also, care must be taken so as to not weaken the shaft when welding the discs to the shaft.\n\nA better rotor design utilizes discs with square holes, which are slid onto square shafts and separated by round spacer collars. A threaded locking mechanism is utilized to tighten the discs firmly on the shaft. It is necessary that the appropriate thread (left hand or right hand) is used to prevent the locking nut from loosening during rotation.\n\nThe advantages of this design include:\n\n- Discs can be replaced when worn out.\n- The possibility of disc-to-shaft weld failure is eliminated.\n- The discs are positively driven by the square shaft.\n- If desired, the disc spacing can be changed by replacing the spacer collars separating the discs.\n\nThe periphery of the discs is profiled to provide agitation. The shape of the profile depends upon the material being handled and the vendor's specific design. Generally, 6-point stars are used for wood chips and discs with 6 rounded lobes are used for hog fuel and other stringy biomass.\n\n## Disc Metallurgy and Thickness\n\nScalping screens require discs made of an abrasion resistant steel with a Bhn >360.\n\nBiomass scalping screen discs are generally 3/8\" thick. However, most of the fines containing sand, dirt and grit fall through the first few rotors and this part of the screen is subject to the highest wear. Therefore it is advisable to utilize somewhat thicker discs (1/2\") in this part of the screen.\n\n## Disc Outside Diameter\n\nThe tips of the disc points or lobes should have minimal clearance (~1/4\") to the adjacent shaft assembly collar; this dictates the maximum disc outside diameter.\n\nScreens with a large disc diameter and small collar diameter provide greater agitation and a greater % open area, so can have an overall smaller footprint. However, they have a longer slot length and will tend to pass longer pieces of material.\n\n## Rotor Speed\n\nExperience has determined a nominal rotor speed of approximately 30-50 rpm for most woody biomass depending upon disc and spacer collar outside diameters. Some applications may call for a gradually increasing speed between shafts to further separate and pull apart the interlocked material on the screen.\n\nGenerally, increasing overall screen speed will increase the amount of material rejected over the end of the screen and have the effect of increasing screen capacity. Conversely, decreasing the speed increases the dwell time and increases the amount of material passing through the screen but decreases screen capacity. Note: the effect is not linear.\n\n## Screen Width\n\nAs a minimum, disc screens should be somewhat wider than the feed conveyor; for example, a 48\" or 54\" wide screen for a 42\" belt conveyor. However, the most important factor for determining screen width is the amount of material being delivered to the screen. For a given volume of material, a narrow screen will have a much deeper bed depth of material than will a wide screen and it will take much longer for the undersized material to percolate down through the bed.\n\nConversely, it can be difficult to spread the incoming material across the width of a very wide screen. This can sometimes be done with deflector plates but on very wide screens a distribution screw or similar device might be required, depending upon the material being screened.\n\n## Shaft Assembly Bearings\n\nSome disc screen designs utilize flanged bearings which are OK from a load perspective; however care must be taken to mount them outboard of the screen frame where material cannot get jammed into the bearing seals. Flanged bearings are useful where you need the shaft assemblies to be closely spaced.\n\nBearings are subject to high side loads due to material wedging between adjacent rotating discs. Therefore, one bearing on each shaft, usually the one on the drive side, should be firmly anchored against a shoulder on the shaft, in order to prevent the shafts from shifting sideways in the bearing.\n\nShafts secured only with adapter-mounted bearings are not secure enough to prevent rotor shafts shifting laterally, thereby disrupting the IFO accuracy.\n\nThe best screen design utilizes pillow block bearings mounted outboard of the screen frame. The PB bearings are located with bearing keepers welded to the frame. This arrangement has the following advantages:\n\n- It eliminates the problem of slivers jamming through and ruining the bearing seals\n- It provides for a stronger frame\n- It enables the shaft assemblies to be easily lifted off of the screen\n\nFor bearing interchangeability, it may be necessary to machine the ends of each bearing base to produce a uniform pillow block length.\n\n## Dust Seals\n\nThe shaft assemblies should be equipped with UHMW plastic dust seals located on the outside of the frame, the intent being to minimize fugitive dusting around the shaft where it passes through the frame.\n\n## Drives\n\nIt is common to drive one rotor shaft directly from a gearbox and then drive the other shafts from the first shaft with inter-rotor drive chains or belts. Due to the shock loads that can develop in a disc screen it is best to limit the number of shafts driven from any one drive to 8 or less. For example, on a 12-rotor screen you would used two drives instead of one, with each one driving 6 rotors.\n\nGearboxes can be shaft-mounted or foot-mounted and direct coupled to the screen or have a low-speed chain drive. Motors can be C-flange mounted or direct coupled to the gearbox or have a V-belt high speed drive.\n\n## Inter-rotor Drives\n\nEach rotor must be driven. The usual method is to drive one roll from the next with a roller chain drive located on one side of the machine. For this application, double-single sprockets keyed to the shaft are required. Alternatively, single sprockets can be located on each end of the rotor shaft.\n\nSerpentine roller chain drives have also been utilized, where a single chain passes over each successive sprocket. However, this application is limited to light duty screens due to the low number of sprocket teeth engaged in the chain. The roller chain wrap can be increased by utilizing idler sprockets between each rotor, but this requires a lot of space and is more complex than separate roll-to-roll drives.\n\nRoller chain drives require lubrication to reduce wear and prolong life. Properly designed oil bath chain guards that minimize the ingress of dust are the best.\n\nCogged belt drives have also been for inter-rotor drives. However, they require considerably more space than roller chain. They have the advantages of being much quieter and not requiring lubrication.\n\nIt is usual to put the inter-rotor drives on one side of the machine and the main drive(s) on the other side.\n\nDisc screens should have slow speed switches on the last roll in any drive sequence. The slow speed switch can be utilized to detect a broken drive chain or a drive which has stalled due to a jammed screen.\n\n## Anti-Jam System\n\nDisc screens can be jammed by wedge-shaped rocks, metal, large pieces of wood, wire or stringy bark. Consequently, it is advisable to have an anti-jam system on every disc screen.\n\nWhen a screen section jams, it is detected by the slow speed switch, which sends a signal to the PLC. The PLC then initiates the following run sequence:\n\n- Start-up and run in reverse for 2 – 3 seconds, then stop.\n- Start-up and run forward.\n- If still jammed, run the reverse / forward sequence for a maximum of 3-4 times and if still jammed, then shut the screen down and signal the operator to attend to the machine.\n\nThe screen drives should be interlocked to preceding conveyors such that they will stop when the screen stops.\n\n## Feed Onto Biomass Disc Screens\n\nGenerally when handling biomass, it is best to have the screen in-line with the feed conveyor, particularly where you have long pieces and big chunks of wood. Try to avoid turns of 90° onto the screen, but if necessary, provide for extra height and a long, wide chute to allow the big pieces to turn. Pre-hogged material coming direct from upstream hogs should not contain many big pieces, so feeding at 90° should be OK.\n\nThe material should not drop directly on the top of the screen discs, as long thin pieces will dive straight through the screen.\n\nThe infeed chutework should be designed so as to evenly spread the material across the width of the screen. Diverters or deflectors can be added to the chutework if necessary, as long as they don't impede the flow onto the screen.\n\nThe infeed chute before the screen should be at least 55° from the horizontal.\n\nThe screen should have a short integral infeed chute and impact plate above the first rotor to bridge the gap between the screen end plate and the first rotor. The impact plate is profiled with fingers that fit closely to the discs and collars of the first rotor and is sloped at approximately 35° from the horizontal, the intent being to deflect long slivers horizontally onto the screen.\n\n## Chutework\n\nAcceptable material passing through the screen will contain the smallest particle fraction, which will fall through the first part of the screen. This fraction also contains most of the sand, dirt, grit, snow, ice, etc., which can build-up on the chute plates underneath the screen in areas which are not scoured clean by the falling larger particles. Build-up can be particularly bad in the valley angles between intersecting chute plates. The chute plates should be as steep as possible, with valley angles at a minimum of 55° from the horizontal. Dribble chutes outside of the main flow should be >60° from the horizontal. Sliding surfaces should be constructed of steel plate at least ¼\" thick. In particularly high wear areas a wear liner could be considered. UHMW liners can be used to minimize material sticking or freezing to the chutework.\n\nReject material passing over the end of the disc screen can be quite big. The reject chutework should be designed sufficiently strong to handle the impact of large pieces of wood. Ideally as with feed chutes, material which contains gross oversized pieces that are rejected over the end of the screen, should not be made to turn through 90° chutes. However, this is not always possible to avoid; therefore, the chutes should be wide enough to pass the largest piece rejected.\n\nLarge inspection / access / cleanout doors should be provided in all chutes. Plugged chute switches should be located in chutes wherever there is the possibility that chutes will plug up with material.\n\n## Screen Elevation\n\nThe elevation of the screen is determined by the elevation of the equipment or bunker into which the screen is discharging. The screen must be high enough above the downstream equipment or bunker to discharge with suitable chute angles.\n\nMost disc screens are mounted on the horizontal, but in some applications work best with either a slight incline or decline.\n\n## Screen Maintenance\n\nProperly designed and constructed disc screens are rugged pieces of equipment that typically run for long periods of time without shutting down for maintenance; so much so, that preventative maintenance is often overlooked until the equipment is in poor repair. Screens typically run all year without major servicing.\n\nThe screen should be located in the system such that it can be bypassed or physically removed from the process with minimal effort. This can achieved by mounting the screen on wheels and rails so that it can be pulled sideways or lengthways out of operating position. Typically, temporary chutework is put in place so that the system can still run when the screen is out of position. Alternatively, a flop-gate can be installed on the feed chute to the screen, which will bypass the material around the screen. When the screen has been bypassed or removed, care must be taken not to jam up downstream equipment with gross oversized pieces of wood.\n\n## Dust Control\n\nProcessing dry wood and bark through disc screens can be very dusty, so the screen should be equipped with sealed covers. All components of a system including conveyors, chutes and screens should be properly enclosed and ventilated in order to keep a negative pressure inside the equipment, thereby minimizing fugitive dusting.\n\n## Reprocessing Screen Rejects\n\nGross oversized screen rejects can be:\n\n- Discarded in a landfill if heavily contaminated with rocks\n- Reprocessed though a secondary hog and reintroduced into the processed hog fuel flow.\n\n## Other Varieties of Disc Screens\n\n**Star screens** utilize interlocking flexible finger-discs on high speed shafts and are suitable for light, sticky materials such as straw, poultry litter or compost. These are not suitable for handling large, heavy chunks of wood. They have a large open area but are not very precise.\n\n**Delta screens** utilize delta shaped in-line discs forming a consistent sized opening between the discs and shafts. They are quite precise but tend to have a low open area requiring a large screen footprint.\n\n---\n\n*Updated December 2020*\n\n*Copyright © December 2020*\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years of experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing, plant trouble-shooting, optimization and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

It consists of a series of driven shaft assemblies mounted in a frame. Each rotor shaft assembly has profiled discs mounted at regular spacings. The discs from one shaft interleaf with those on the adjacent shafts, creating open areas between the discs and the shafts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Incoming material is fed onto one end of the screen. The shaft assemblies rotate, and the discs agitate the material. Pieces of material that are smaller than the spacing between the discs and shaft assemblies fall through the screen. The pieces that are larger than the openings are conveyed along the top of the discs and pass over the end of the screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Disc screens are particularly useful for screening biomass for the following reasons:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>They provide good agitation, which is necessary for separating the biomass particles which tend to knit together.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>They are designed to handle rocks and other large, heavy contaminants without damage.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>They will withstand a lot of wear from abrasion.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"applications\">Applications\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Disc Screens can be used for:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Scalping screens\u003C/strong>, where the object is to remove oversized material from the product flow.

The purpose of this article is to provide some general design fundamentals. The paper focuses on the scalping screen application, but many of the comments are applicable to all disc screens. Disc screen design is more of an art based on experience than on science.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"disc-screen-sizing\">Disc Screen Sizing\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Disc screen size is determined by:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>The volume of incoming material.

The determining factors are:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Width of the screen\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>How well the material is spread across the width of the screen\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The cohesiveness of the material being handled\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The amount of undersized material in the flow\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The maximum possible surge flow\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Disc screens should be sized such that under the maximum possible flow conditions, all the undersized material has passed through the screen with at least 1-2 rotors clear at the end of the screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"slot-length-and-disc-ifo\">Slot Length and Disc IFO\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Disc screen openings have two dimensions (slot length and IFO). Theoretically, the maximum sized piece that can pass through a scalping screen is one that has the dimensions of the IFO and slot length and is of an infinite length. Practically speaking, if screens are fed properly such that long pieces are not allowed to fall end-wise onto and through the screen, the maximum piece passing through a screen will be a little bit longer than twice the slot length. Hence it is desirable to keep the slot length as short as possible in order to reduce the size of the longest piece passing through the screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Slot length is the distance between adjacent shaft assembly spacer collars and is determined by:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Rotor spacing\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Spacer collar diameter\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Disc diameter and clearance between tip of one disc and collar of adjacent shaft\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The disc Interface Opening (IFO) is defined as the spacing between interleafed discs on adjacent shaft assemblies. Generally, it has been learned from experience that the disc interface opening (IFO) should be somewhat smaller than the target product size; e.g. – IFO = &#x3C;3″ for a target size of &#x3C;4″.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Screens may have one or more disc IFO’s. It is advisable that the first 2 – 3 rotors to be sliver orientation rotors, which have a narrow IFO of &#x3C; ¾”, the idea being to encourage long pieces of wood to lie down on the screen and to prevent them from diving through the screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In some screening applications, multiple size classifications may be required where fine material is removed in the first part of the screen and larger fractions in the middle and last screen sections.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Disc IFO and screen width dictates the number of discs required on each shaft assembly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>IFO is fairly easy to change, so when selecting a screen, the most attention is paid to getting the correct IFO in order to get the correct product sizing. As noted above, slot-length is determined by the basic machine design. However, paying attention to the slot-length is important, too, when selecting a screen. Slot-length is particularly important when selecting screens that are screening small material.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"rotor-spacings\">Rotor Spacings\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The minimum rotor spacing is usually limited by the space required to accommodate shaft assembly bearings or the inter-rotor drive components. The rotor spacing must match the actual inter-rotor drive roller chain or cogged belt sprocket center distance precisely in order to maintain a tight drive. Roller chain drives should have oil lubrication to reduce wear.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"rotor-discs\">Rotor Discs\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The rotor discs are mounted at pre-determined spacings on the disc shaft. The discs can be clamped between spacers or permanently fixed to the shaft by welding. The lowest cost screens use welded discs, but when the discs have worn out the entire shaft assembly must be discarded and replaced. Also, care must be taken so as to not weaken the shaft when welding the discs to the shaft.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A better rotor design utilizes discs with square holes, which are slid onto square shafts and separated by round spacer collars. A threaded locking mechanism is utilized to tighten the discs firmly on the shaft. It is necessary that the appropriate thread (left hand or right hand) is used to prevent the locking nut from loosening during rotation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The advantages of this design include:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Discs can be replaced when worn out.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The possibility of disc-to-shaft weld failure is eliminated.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The discs are positively driven by the square shaft.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If desired, the disc spacing can be changed by replacing the spacer collars separating the discs.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The periphery of the discs is profiled to provide agitation. The shape of the profile depends upon the material being handled and the vendor’s specific design. Generally, 6-point stars are used for wood chips and discs with 6 rounded lobes are used for hog fuel and other stringy biomass.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"disc-metallurgy-and-thickness\">Disc Metallurgy and Thickness\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Scalping screens require discs made of an abrasion resistant steel with a Bhn >360.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Biomass scalping screen discs are generally 3/8” thick. However, most of the fines containing sand, dirt and grit fall through the first few rotors and this part of the screen is subject to the highest wear. Therefore it is advisable to utilize somewhat thicker discs (1/2”) in this part of the screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"disc-outside-diameter\">Disc Outside Diameter\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The tips of the disc points or lobes should have minimal clearance (~1/4”) to the adjacent shaft assembly collar; this dictates the maximum disc outside diameter.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Screens with a large disc diameter and small collar diameter provide greater agitation and a greater % open area, so can have an overall smaller footprint. However, they have a longer slot length and will tend to pass longer pieces of material.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"rotor-speed\">Rotor Speed\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Experience has determined a nominal rotor speed of approximately 30-50 rpm for most woody biomass depending upon disc and spacer collar outside diameters. Some applications may call for a gradually increasing speed between shafts to further separate and pull apart the interlocked material on the screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Generally, increasing overall screen speed will increase the amount of material rejected over the end of the screen and have the effect of increasing screen capacity. Conversely, decreasing the speed increases the dwell time and increases the amount of material passing through the screen but decreases screen capacity. Note: the effect is not linear.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"screen-width\">Screen Width\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>As a minimum, disc screens should be somewhat wider than the feed conveyor; for example, a 48” or 54” wide screen for a 42” belt conveyor. However, the most important factor for determining screen width is the amount of material being delivered to the screen. For a given volume of material, a narrow screen will have a much deeper bed depth of material than will a wide screen and it will take much longer for the undersized material to percolate down through the bed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Conversely, it can be difficult to spread the incoming material across the width of a very wide screen. This can sometimes be done with deflector plates but on very wide screens a distribution screw or similar device might be required, depending upon the material being screened.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"shaft-assembly-bearings\">Shaft Assembly Bearings\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Some disc screen designs utilize flanged bearings which are OK from a load perspective; however care must be taken to mount them outboard of the screen frame where material cannot get jammed into the bearing seals.

And, for decades residual wastewood has been well-utilized as a fuel source for industrial plants. However, there is little incentive in Canada to utilize standing forests for fuel as we have such a small population, and an abundant supply of low-cost energy, for example, hydro power in BC, oil in Alberta, nuclear power in Ontario.\n\nLikewise, Russia and the southeastern USA have large amounts of wood fibre available that can be used for energy production.\n\nBiomass is not an easy material to handle. It appears in a myriad of species, forms and sizes; it knits together, doesn't flow well, consolidates and packs easily; it can have a wide range of moisture contents, basic and bulk densities and calorific values; it will freeze; it is very dusty, catches fire easily and is self-combustible; it can contain all manner of contaminants. Conversely, wood pellets are uniform in size and moisture content, are very free flowing, but are quite fragile and easily degrade and require special handling.\n\nCurrently, most of the wood pellets imported into Europe come from the province of British Columbia in Canada. Historically, most of the wood pellets have been manufactured from residual wastes from sawmills and other primary wood manufacturing plants. However, due to the collapse of the US housing market, lumber production has decreased significantly; and therefore, the amount of wastewood residuals available for pellets has decreased.\n\nCompared to manufacturing wood pellets out of residual wastes, producing them from standing forests is significantly more costly as the process includes several more steps including logging, chipping and transportation. This increases the cost to the end-user.\n\nThe only way that wood pellet production is profitable is if the process is heavily subsidized by governments, which is what is happening in Europe. However, the wood pellet business is suffering right now due to: a) – high fibre costs; b)– a world-wide over-supply of pellets due to several new pellet plants starting-up; and c) – the economic crisis in Europe. Some of the new pellet plants in the USA have declared bankruptcy and have been shut down. In spite of this, the production and utilization of wood pellets is expected to increase in the next few years. Domestic use in the USA is also expected to increase due to that countries recent 'green' energy initiatives. And, in the province of Ontario in Canada, the provincial power authority, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), is considering converting three of its coal-fired power plants to biomass. This will put more pressure on the pellet supply and pricing.\n\nAs far as Europe is concerned, the challenge is getting the wood fibre from distant countries such as Canada, USA or Russia in a form that has the greatest value. The energy density of a fuel is prime consideration in reducing shipping costs, but that has to be weighed against the cost of producing the fuel. Suffice it to say that generally, the denser the fuel and the higher the btu's per pound, the better the fuel.\n\nSome companies are considering importing wood chips or hog fuel into Europe; this might prove economical from eastern Russia or from the Scandanavian countries, but most of the biomass being imported from overseas will likely be some form of pre-processed densified wood. Currently, the greatest amount of densified wood being imported into Europe is in the form of wood pellets. However, there is considerable interest in importing carbon pellets manufactured from torrified biomass. The torrefaction process has been utilized on a small scale for many decades, but it is now being improved and commercialized. Additionally, bio-oils are being developed and may become a significant fuel source for Europe.\n\nWood pellets will likely continue to make up the greatest portion of woody biomass being imported into Europe, however, I believe that torrified wood pellets will soon become a significant portion. Consequently, I intend to limit my discussion here to the handling characteristics and requirements of these two materials.\n\n## Wood Pellets\n\nWood pellets are made from softwood or hardwood trees, which are logged, debarked, chipped, dried, conditioned, pelletized, and screened. The pellets are held together simply as a function of pressure and the lignin that is present in the wood. Currently, >90% of wood pellets are made to a premium quality with the following characteristics:\n\n- A minimum density of 642 kg/m³ (40 lb/ft³)\n- Diameter: 6.4 – 8.0 mm (1/4\" – 5/16\")\n- Length: 38 mm (1 ½\") maximum\n- Ash: \u003C0.5% by weight (Premium pellets are designed for domestic use in the home)\n\nIndustrial or standard grade pellets are made from wood and bark and they differ from the premium pellets only in the permissible ash content, which is \u003C3% by weight. There is a trend in Europe to construct or convert large power boilers that will utilize standard grade pellets; hence, the amount of standard grade pellets imported into Europe will increase.\n\nWood pellets have the following handling characteristics:\n\n- They flow well and if stored properly are not prone to bridging.\n- They are fragile and easily break up when handled.\n- The dust produced is very fine, combustible and explosive.\n- They are quite dry at 12-15%, but absorb water readily, swell and fall apart.\n\n## Shipping and Unloading\n\nWood pellets tend to break up every time they are handled; they break up at every transfer point and even from rubbing together when being transported. When they break up, a very fine, talc-like dust is produced, which is difficult to contain and presents a significant fire and explosion risk. The more times pellets are handled the more they break up and the greater the fibre loss.\n\nCurrent practices have pellets being handled many times between the manufacturing plant and the transport ship. Prospective importers should insist on the product being screened to remove the fines immediately prior to ship loading.\n\nMost wood pellets are shipped in bulk form in 30 – 40,000 tonne ships. In order to avoid demurrage costs, these ships must be loaded and unloaded as quickly as possible; this requires that high capacity, material handling facilities be constructed at the loading and unloading ports. Care must be taken in the design of these systems to minimize pellet degradation. Utilizing existing coal unloading facilities makes considerable sense; however these need to be modified in order to handle pellets with the required care.\n\n### Ship Unloading\n\nPneumatic ship unloaders are particularly hard on wood pellets and should be avoided. Clamshell bucket unloaders or screw unloaders also cause pellet damage.\n\nWood pellets flow well and are conducive to being transported in self-unloading ships which utilize special-built holds with live-bottom belt feeders that discharge into a sandwich-belt type of ship unloader that elevates the pellets up and out of the ship.\n\n## Conveying Systems\n\nAll conveying systems that encourage impacts or rubbing, wedging or grinding actions should be avoided; including chain conveyors and screw conveyor feeder / extractors. The least damaging method of handling wood pellets is carrying them on belt conveyors; however, care must be taken to properly design the conveyor transfers to minimize the impact points. Additionally, care must be taken to protect the wood pellets from the weather.\n\nConveyors should be equipped with heat, smoke and flame sensors, sprinklers and fire suppression equipment.\n\nIdeally, tubular belt conveyors that can accommodate both vertical and horizontal curves and therefore minimize the number of transfer points, would be used.\n\n## Storage and Reclaiming\n\nWood pellets must stored under cover and kept dry to minimize deterioration due to weather. Their good flowability allows the use of storage silos, but care must be taken in the design of silo loader and discharger. Pellets falling from a great height will be broken, therefore a spiral loading chute or a cascade loading chute is preferred.\n\nThe action of mechanical dischargers underneath the load of a high silo can cause significant damage to pellets. However, pellets flow well, therefore silos can be designed without a mechanical discharger; but care must be taken with the design of the silo bottom.\n\nA good silo discharging system would utilize a long belt feeder passing underneath the centerline of a line of silos. Each silo has a bottom that is sloped towards the center of the silo; multiple gates above the belt feeder can be sequentially opened to allow the pellets to flow through.\n\nSmaller bins and hoppers that utilize dischargers such as a 'Kamengo' feeder or a 'Keith Walking Floor' have a gentle action that minimizes product damage.\n\nSilos and hoppers should be equipped with deluge systems and rupture vents and dust suppression should be considered for open-topped hoppers.\n\n## Land Transportation\n\nFor long overland distances, train transport is usually more economical than that by truck. However, standard gondola cars that require emptying on a roll-over dumper should be avoided due to the pellet damage associated with the high material impacts. Bottom-discharge gondola cars are suitable.\n\nTransportation by bulk trucks is the most common method of moving pellets moderate distances. Several types and sizes of trucks are available and can be self-unloading or non-self unloading. Non-self unloading trucks need to be emptied on a side or end tipper. Care must be taken with the design of the tipper and receiving hopper to minimize the drop and subsequent material impacts and corresponding fibre loss.\n\nSelf-unloading trucks that utilize pneumatic conveyors, chains and screws should be avoided in order to minimize product damage. Because pellets flow well, conventional bottom-discharging grain trucks can be utilized. Likewise, trucks with gentle 'Walking Floors' can also be used.\n\n## Screening / Metal Removal\n\nScreens that impart vibratory or wedging and grinding actions should be avoided, as they will contribute to product degradation. Wood pellets are best screened on flat, gyratory screens such as that manufactured by 'BM&M Screening Solutions'.\n\nGenerally, wood pellets are clean and have few contaminants when manufactured; however, after transportation from the manufacturing facility, shipping, unloading, land transportation, storage and reclaiming there is the possibility that metal has entered the product stream. Drum magnets and self-cleaning belt magnets are suitable for removing tramp ferrous metal from wood pellets. The best location for tramp metal removal is over a belt conveyor head pulley where the material is suspended in air.\n\n## Dust Collection / Fire Protection\n\nWhen handled, wood pellets produce a very fine dust that will hang in the air and travel long distances in a slight breeze. The dust is highly flammable and explosive, so all enclosures should be well ventilated and the ventilation air processed through a dust collector. Well designed and maintained dust collection systems utilizing baghouses are essential. High efficiency cyclones have difficulty separating the fine dust particles from the air stream and should be utilized only as a pre-separator, prior to a baghouse. Dust collection systems should be equipped with spark detection systems, deluge systems and abort gates. However, it is far better to design the handling systems to minimize the amount of dust generated.\n\n## Crushing / Grinding\n\nIn some instances, consideration is being given to co-firing wood pellets with coal in existing coal-fired plants. To do so, necessitates that the wood pellets be reduced to a particle size similar to coal. Wood pellets easily break up and can be processed through high-capacity granulators. Some power companies are experimenting with processing wood pellets in coal pulverizers.\n\n## Alternative Pellet Transportation\n\nHandling wood pellets in bulk form results in product degradation and fibre loss. Two alternative methods of handling wood pellets involve loading them at the manufacturing plant into either large bags or containers and transporting them to the end-user this way; the intent being to minimize handling and therefore product degradation.\n\nHowever, the size of bag that can be handled is limited and bags are easily damaged. Standard 20' shipping containers are ideal; they can be filled to capacity, whereas, 40' containers cannot. Care must be taken to ship containers below decks to keep them dry.\n\n## Torrified Wood Pellets\n\nTorrified pellets can be made from agricultural wastes or from woody biomass. The biomass is heated in a reactor at low temperature in the absence of oxygen. Torrefaction is a thermo-chemical process in which the hemi-cellulose decomposes producing various volatile gases and leaving a solid residue resembling coal. The gases can be converted to various chemicals and fuels. The solid residue is ground-up and pelletized.\n\nMost of the comments regarding wood pellet handling issues apply to handling torrified pellets; however there are some significant differences. Torrifed pellets have several advantages over wood pellets.\n\n- They are approximately 30% more dense and their energy density is approximately 70% higher, which means lower transportation and storage costs.\n- They are stable and don't decompose, which means a lower fire hazard.\n- They have a lower moisture content and will not easily absorb water and therefore can be stored outdoors.\n- Their pellet strength is better and they don't break up as easily when handled; meaning that losses and dusting issues are lower.\n- They handle like coal and are better suited to processing through existing coal handling facilities.\n\n*Copyright 2010*\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

High efficiency cyclones have difficulty separating the fine dust particles from the air stream and should be utilized only as a pre-separator, prior to a baghouse.

Wood pellets are manufactured from small wood particles, generally \u003C3.0mm (\u003C1/8″), which are compressed in pelletizers into small cylinders 6-8mm in dia. x up to 50mm long. Pellets are held together by the binding action of the lignin that is naturally present in the wood fibre, acting under pressure. From the moment they exit the pelletizer and fall into the receiving conveyor, the pellets start to break up. At every conveyor transfer point, in bucket elevators, screw and chain conveyors, falling into bins, loading into trucks, railcars or ships, they degrade some more. Every time they are handled by crane or mobile equipment, they break up a bit more into their constituent parts. The best way to reduce product damage and small particle generation is to handle the pellets as gently as possible. Falling >30m (100′) into a silo results in high velocity impact forces, breakage and dusting. Consequently when faced with the problem on a recent project, we developed a spiral / helical chute which allows pellets to slide rather than freefall to the bottom of a silo.\n\n## Wood Pellet Degradation\n\nThere are operational, commercial, health and safety ramifications associated with wood pellet degradation.\n\nWood pellet combustors are designed to burn material within a certain size distribution. Bulk pellets which contain too many fines, burn too quickly and inefficiently and can cause emissions problems. Consequently, the Wood Pellet Association of Canada (WPAC), the Pellet Fuels Institute (PFI) in the US and ENplus in Europe all have standards that dictate wood pellet quality, including limiting the amount of loose fines present in bulk wood pellets.\n\nMost pellet supply contracts have penalty clauses for 'out of spec' pellets; so, from a commercial aspect, wood pellet breakage should be minimized wherever possible to avoid penalties.\n\nMinimizing pellet breakage is an important safety and health consideration. As pellets break, very fine, talc-like particles are generated, which tend to float and move in airborne currents and if not controlled can accumulate in clouds of dust, which are flammable and very explosive. The most dangerous particles are smaller than 1/100th of the smallest particle size shown in the following photo. Additionally, the very fine dust when drawn into the lungs can cause breathing problems and prolonged exposure can result in poor health.\n\nWood pellet breakage cannot be eliminated, but it can be minimized by:\n\n- Reducing the number of times wood pellets are handled between manufacturer and the end-user.\n- Reducing conveyor speeds and therefore impacts at transfer points, and utilizing 'soft chutes' at transfer points.\n- Minimizing the use of equipment such as screw reclaimers that tend to shear the pellets and chain conveyors that crush pellets.\n- Not using dilute phase pneumatic conveyor delivery systems which utilize high speed air for transporting the pellets and have high impacts at all elbows.\n- Not driving mobile equipment on pellets.\n- Not dropping wood pellets great distances into bins, silos or ship holds. It is this last item that this article addresses.\n\n## Helical Chute\n\nDuring the pre-feasibility stage of a recent project, I was asked how I would reduce the consequent breakage and fine particle generation that results from dropping pellets >30m (100′) into a silo. My response was to use a spiral / helical chute, which would allow the pellets to slide at a controlled rate to the bottom of the silo, thereby reducing the high velocity impact forces, breakage, small particle generation and dusting. Unlike a telescopic cascade chute, a spiral / helical chute is a static piece of equipment with no electrical or mechanical components requiring maintenance and has no power source as a potential spark generator. We subsequently won the contract for the design of the helical chute.\n\n## History of Spiral Chutes\n\nSpiral chutes have been around for more than 100 years and today are used mainly for handling packaged material in discrete elements such as:\n\n- Newspaper bundles from one floor to another\n- Airport luggage\n- Mail at a sorting centre\n- Bags of cement being loaded into ships\n- Potato chips in a food factory\n\n## Helical / Spiral Chute Development\n\nDuring the design phase of the project, we discovered that using a spiral / helical chute for the gentle handling of bulk materials inside a silo is totally different from discrete package handling and had its own host of design issues to resolve.\n\nThe design of the helical chute needs to accommodate several conflicting requirements.\n\n- The need to slow the material as much as possible using a shallow, sloped chute in order to reduce the consequent impacts and small particle generation.\n- The need to keep a fairly steep chute slope so that the material will restart sliding having once stopped.\n- The need for a self-cleaning chute that doesn't require emptying the silo completely before exposing the bottom of the chute so that it can self-clean.\n- The need to resist the centrifugal forces and contain the sliding material inside the helical chute until reaching the top of the pile and then having it spill out of the chute onto the pile.\n- The need to design a chute that can withstand the tremendous vertical draw-down forces during silo emptying that result from the column of material slowly sliding past the chute flights that are buried inside the mass of material.\n- The need to design a chute that can withstand the tremendous side loads that exist at the transition between the silo barrel and the silo cone, or the side loads that could result from an eccentric silo load.\n\n## Flow Simulation Modeling\n\nTo simulate the pellet flow down the chute, we used Discrete Element Method (DEM) modeling software, which permitted us to test and confirm several different chute arrangements before committing to a design. We used test data from Jenike & Johnson in our simulation and flow calculations.\n\nComputer modelling the flow and movement of small particles requires trillions of computer calculations. The smaller and more diverse the particle sizes, the more calculations are required; and the more calculations there are, the longer the simulation run-time required. And, if the run result determines that a change is needed, a new model must be created and the simulation run re-started.\n\nWe discovered that with the trillions of calculations to simulate the possible interactions between the pellets in the chute, the 24-core computer, which we were using would have to run for weeks on a single model before we could get a definitive result.\n\nConsequently, I decided to build a physical model of a helical chute and silo and test different helical chute configurations with real pellets and pellet fines. I built (4) models before finding a satisfactory combination of design parameters. *[Note: Original video demonstration and photos were available from the source website but may not be accessible.]*\n\nWe subsequently used the computer simulation models to verify the findings from my physical models, and eventually chose a design configuration that best satisfied all of the flow requirements. The calculated speed of the pellets was reduced by a factor of 4 as compared to a free-fall; therefore, it is assumed that the impacts and consequent degradation were decreased a like amount.\n\n## Project Implementation\n\nWe completed both the process / mechanical and structural designs and the helical chute was fabricated and installed in (2) silos at a power plant in Ontario, Canada. To handle >500tph, the helical chute is quite large, 2.4m' (8′) in diameter mounted on a 1200mm (4′) pipe column x 33m (108′) high. The flights and pipe are fabricated out of heavy carbon steel plate in order to withstand the tremendous loads. Although flow tests have not been carried out on the helical chutes, they appear to be working satisfactorily.\n\n## Other Uses for Helical Chutes\n\nThe helical chute would be suitable for use wherever delicate or dusty materials such as grains or other agri-products have to be dropped from a considerable height and product degradation and small particle generation is to be avoided.\n\nLoading wood chips and wood pellets into ships holds has always been a dusty activity, resulting in both health and environmental hazards. A covered helical chute equipped with dust control would work well in this application; likewise, loading ships with other dusty materials.\n\nCurved helical chutes could be utilized at transfers between conveyors which are traveling in different directions, to present a smooth directional transition.\n\n---\n\n*Copyright © 22 October 2014*\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

It has also been a constant refrain heard for decades in pulp and paper mills throughout the world.\n\nMiniscule tramp particles of plastic are present in most pulp and paper, and can cause numerous and costly operating problems not only for the pulp producer but also for the end-user. Plastic particles become embedded in the pulp and can cause the sheet to tear during processing or will become coated on equipment and cause streaks in the pulp. Additionally, plastic particles embedded in paper will not accept printing ink.\n\nIndeed, plastic contamination in pulp is a small but significant and costly problem in pulp manufacture; the amount of plastic in one small plastic pen can ruin 1,000 tonnes of pulp. Generally, the industry has done a great job of controlling the amount of plastic used in a pulp mill, but plastic contamination is still a significant problem that mill operators keep a 'keen' eye on.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no 'magic bullet', when it comes to eliminating plastic contamination. Removing plastic from pulp is almost impossible, so the best solution is to prevent plastic from getting into the wood chips and pulp in the first place.\n\n## 1. Prevention\n\nThe key steps in minimizing plastic contamination are:\n\n- **Keeping tramp plastic out of the wood chip supply stream** to the mill is the best way to reduce plastic contamination. This requires working with the mill's wood chip suppliers and haulers to educate them about the consequences of plastic contamination and ensuring that they are taking the necessary steps to keep tramp plastic out of the chips. It is also a good idea to conduct unannounced audits of the wood supplier's facilities.\n\n- **Instituting a good 'plastic is drastic' awareness program** in the mill, and training everyone to be on the lookout for and picking-up tramp plastic and disposing of it properly.\n\n- **Minimizing the use of plastic in the mill**, particularly where it has a chance of getting into the pulp fibre supply.\n\n- **Using 'pulp-safe' plastics** where plastics are required.\n\n- Generally, pulp-safe plastic is considered to have a melting point >160°C and a specific gravity >1.0.\n\n- **Redwood Plastics** makes a wonderful pulp-safe UHMW wearplate called 'Synsteel', that has good, low-friction anti-wear characteristics and has metal embedded in it that enables the material to be picked-up by a magnet or detected by a metal detector. Many mills use Synsteel almost exclusively for wearplates. [https://www.redwoodplastics.com/products/uhmw-polyethylene/redco-synsteel/](https://www.redwoodplastics.com/products/uhmw-polyethylene/redco-synsteel/)\n\n- Redwood also makes another plastic wearplate called SPS, that dissolves in the Kraft pulping chemicals.\n\nIt takes rigorous attention to follow the above steps, and even these do not guarantee complete elimination of plastic.\n\n## 2. Plastic Removal from Wood Chips\n\nRemoving small particles of plastic from wood chips is not practically possible. Unfortunately, most tramp plastic has similar physical characteristics to wood in that it is light and buoyant, so cannot be separated from wood chips by air density separation or flotation.\n\nOptical sorters are used in material recovery facilities (MRF's) for separating plastic from other materials and can even separate different types of plastic. Optical sorters do a reasonable job of sorting plastic where a large percentage of the material flow contains plastic, but they are not 100% effective and are almost always followed-up by a sorting belt where humans pick through the remaining trash looking for plastic.\n\nOptical sorters would not be effective in keeping plastic out of chips or pulp, as the amount of plastic that can cause damage is so infinitesimal, in the order of -1×10⁻⁹ by weight. Even detecting that small amount of plastic in the chip flow is near-impossible.\n\n## 3. Plastic Awareness Programs\n\nPlastic awareness programs work, but the problem with awareness programs is that everyone becomes tired of hearing the same message and often 'tunes it out'. If the number of plastic contamination instances is increasing, it is likely that complacency is setting-in.\n\nAlso, if there is a high-turnover of mill personnel, the message might not be getting through and it might be necessary to 'step-up' the awareness program intensity.\n\n## 4. Tramp Plastic\n\nI suspect that most plastic contamination at pulpmills is tramp plastic that comes from outside the mill. The likelihood of this source becoming worse is greater if you have a lot of chip suppliers or a lot of new chip truck drivers. So, that means working with the chip suppliers and haulers and making them aware of the dangers of plastic contamination.\n\nPenalizing chip suppliers or haulers doesn't work, because it can be months between the original 'plastic-in-the-chips' contamination and the 'plastic-in-the-pulp' contamination, so is very difficult to prove where the plastic originated.\n\nOnce tramp plastic lands in the truck dumper receiving hopper and makes it onto the chip pile, it is nearly impossible to detect and remove, unless it is a large piece of coloured plastic that the chip dozer operator can see.\n\n---\n\n*Copyright © 2014*\n\n## References\n\n\"Plastic Contamination\", James Olson, Advanced Fibre Processing Laboratory, Faculty of Applied Science, UBC, 31 July 2012.\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

Such ‘front-end loaded’ (FEL) projects give the client confidence in the \\`numbers’ and complete control of the project.\n\nOne of the most important phases is the Project Definition phase where the project is clearly \\`defined’, from both technical / process and cost / benefit perspectives.  Discussions are initiated with potential suppliers, customers, financiers, regulating bodies, environmental groups and other stakeholders; a plant location is selected; plant layouts are developed; a Class 25 capital cost estimate (CCE) is developed for the preliminary alternative(s); a final alternative is selected for development; and a plan for project execution is established.\n\nThis article focuses on the project definition engineering phase, and is written from a process mechanical perspective. Much of the following information is common to all disciplines, but each discipline has its own requirements.\n\n# 1     Definition Phase / Concept Development\n\n## 1.1   Project Objectives\n\nHaving a clear understanding of the project objectives is paramount. You can’t design a system without knowing what it is that you are supposed to be designing.  This sounds quite basic, but is sometimes not clearly defined. Often the client’s various stakeholders have different perspectives of what the objectives should be, and the importance of each objective.\n\nConsequently, it is very important for the client to have a strong project manager / sponsor who has a clear understanding of the project objectives and can keep both the client project team and the constructor’s project team on track.  All communications, instructions and reports must pass through the project manager.\n\nIt is uncommon for a client to have all the necessary process expertise or engineering manpower required to do a large project, and will often select a consultant engineering company to either do the engineering for him or to represent him as Owner’s engineer.\n\nIt is important for the consultant engineer to set up a project design team with a project manager giving good instructions and guidance.\n\nA clear organization chart should be prepared showing the various positions, incumbents and reporting arrangement.\n\n## 1.2   Kick-off Meeting\n\nOnce a project has been awarded to a consultant engineer, one of the first tasks the engineer does is to visit the proposed plant site to meet with the client stakeholders / project team to discuss and confirm their specific requirements and objectives.  Topics covered during the kick-off meeting generally include the following:\n\n-   Personnel introductions and roles, including client, consultant, other engineers, and sometimes key suppliers or contractors.\n-   The client’s description of the project objectives and goals; potential alternatives; and a review of the study work completed to date.\n-   Description of the project battery limits; i.e. – where the project starts and finishes.\n-   Confirmation of the client’s expectations regarding the engineer’s responsibilities.\n-   Description of communication protocols, reporting structure and organization chart(s).\n-   Review of the proposed schedule with important milestone dates.\n-   Review of the initial budget upon which the project economic progress will be measured.\n-   Review of health, safety, and environmental requirements.\n-   Confidentiality.\n\nThe kick-off meeting minutes must be documented and distributed to the project team, as should all important meetings where decisions are made.\n\n## 1.3   Data Gathering\n\nOften, the opportunity presented by the kick-off meeting at the plant site is utilized to gather as much technical data as is readily available.   There might not be a lot of information to gather if it is a \\`greenfield’ site; however, if it is an existing \\`brownfield’ site, the amount of technical detail to be gathered can be extensive.\n\nFollowing is a list and description of the technical information that the engineer will likely require in order to do the definition study.\n\n-   A description of the raw material to be handled.\n-   A description of the target finished product.\n-   Material flow rates.\n-   A site plan (if existing).\n-   General arrangement drawings of existing structures, systems and equipment.\n-   Flow / Process and Control diagrams of existing systems that the new equipment will be tying into.\n-   Location and details of existing process tie-in points.\n-   Site drawing showing structures, underground services, fire protection systems, roads, railways, etc.\n-   A geotechnical soils report, survey and topographical information, if available.\n-   Plant Site / Mill Conditions.\n-   A list of standard components that are to be used on the project (if known).\n-   Location of the electrical room from which electrical power will be drawn (if existing).\n-   Type of control system required; hard-wired, PLC, DCS.\n\nNormally the engineer will be unable to obtain all of this information immediately, but he can usually get enough information to get started with his work. And of course, if the project is a greenfield installation, then little of this information will be available unless the client is duplicating a mill he has elsewhere.\n\nIt is recommended that the engineer request this information beforehand and do a bit of preparatory work before going to site.  This would include preparing preliminary site layout(s) of the proposed installation and roughing out a process flow diagram (PFD), suitable for generating discussion.\n\n## 1.4   Data Storage and Retrieval\n\nDepending upon the client, existing technical information can be readily obtained, or not.  Large companies typically have an engineering department where the information is stored.  If the department is really good, the information is up-to-date, catalogued and easily retrieved.  In this instance, gathering the required information would be quite easy.\n\nIf the information is not well organized or is not stored in a single place, then data retrieval can be more time consuming, and you might need to ask a lot of questions to just find out where it might be stored.\n\nIf the company is very large and has a central engineering group, the information may not even reside at the local project site.\n\nIn some instances, the information won’t exist and the engineer will need to \\`start from scratch’ and do an extensive field inspection and survey.  Normally, a site survey is not done until the detail engineering phase.\n\n## 1.5   Design Basis Memorandum / Design Criteria\n\nThe design basis memorandum (DBM) should be one of the first documents prepared by the engineer during the definition phase, as it sets down the basic design parameters for the project going forward and includes:\n\n-   A description of the project.\n-   Project objectives.\n-   Type of project – metric or imperial.\n-   Design criteria including:\n    -   Material information – A description of the material being handled, including material characteristics such as species and mix, material form and mix, basic density, bulk factor, bulk density, moisture content (MC), particle size distribution (PSD), contaminants, temperature, abrasiveness, corrosiveness, flow characteristics, angle of repose, angle of drain, etc.; also, proximate and ultimate data (if required and available).\n    -   Required throughput and process flows.\n-   Basic design data and a general scope of work for all disciplines is required:\n    -   Civil / structural / architectural.\n    -   Mechanical / piping / HVAC.\n    -   Electrical / controls.\n    -   Transportation\n\nThe DBM tends to be a \\`living’ document with changes occurring throughout the engineering process as new information becomes available and the design is refined.\n\n## 1.6   Plant Site Conditions / Standard Components\n\nPlant site conditions include information such as:\n\n-   Plant location, elevation, seismic data, precipitation, ambient temperatures, wind data, motor power, control power, compressed air requirements, water specifications, etc.\n-   Standard components that are to be used throughout the plant are often included in the plant conditions document, and include such items as: motors, gearboxes, bearings, belting, idlers, sprockets, RC chain, control devices, hydraulic components, MCC’s, switches, level devices, PLC’s, HMI’s, etc.\n\nPlant conditions are sometimes a stand-alone document, particularly if the plant is existing and already has such a document established.\n\n## 1.7   Flow / Process and Control Diagrams / Single-Line Diagram\n\nProcess Flow Diagrams (PFD’s) are also one of the first documents produced. They are a graphical representation of the main processes showing the equipment used, flow rates, etc., based on preliminary process calculations.\n\nPFD’s are later converted into Process and Control Diagrams (P&C’s) or Process and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&ID’s), which show more detail such as equipment names and numbers, field devices, control symbology and numbers, motor hp, etc.\n\n![diacarbon-162316-000-41103-pfd3](/images/Diacarbon-162316-000-41103-PFD3-300x271.jpg)\n\nFigure 1 – Clipping from Typical Material Handling Flow / Process & Control Diagram\n\nSingle-Line Diagrams (SLD’s) are also developed early in the project process. SLD’s show the basic power sourcing and distribution, motor loads, etc.  SLD’s are generally sufficient for definition phase electrical engineering.\n\n![clipping-from-sld_page_22](/images/Clipping-from-SLD_Page_22-296x300.jpg)\n\nFigure 2 – Simple Typical Electrical Single Line Diagram for Turbine-Generator\n\n## 1.8   Concept Development\n\nOften different alternatives for achieving the project’s objectives are identified during the feasibility phase and need to be assessed during the definition phase, in order to select the most appropriate arrangement.  Some of the alternatives require different process equipment and different equipment layouts, each with its own technical and economic requirements and benefits.  It is often necessary during the definition phase to investigate more than one alternative to ensure the best alternative is selected for further development and detail design.\n\nOne of the first steps in assessing alternatives is to take the available technical information and prepare a background drawing of the project area upon which each of the various alternatives can be overlaid to determine fit and function.\n\nThe alternatives are developed at a very high level, sufficient for discussions with the client, with the intent being that one alternative will be selected for further development.\n\nThe engineer then develops preliminary general arrangement drawings (GA‘s) and elevations of the selected alternative.  These preliminary drawings are presented to the client for his review to ensure that the consultant is on \\`the right track’; that what is being proposed reflects the client’s requirements.\n\nThe engineer then revises the drawings according to the client’s comments and resubmits the drawings for approval of concept.\n\nNote: The client may already have a pre-existing drawing naming and numbering system to which the engineer should conform.\n\nAs mentioned above, design criteria, process calculations and preliminary Flow / Process and Control diagrams are concurrently developed during the definition phase.\n\nThe consultant may also develop energy and mass balances for the process during the definition phase.\n\nSee the following graphics for examples.\n\n![clipping-from-site-plan](/images/Clipping-from-Site-Plan-250x300.jpg)\n\nFigure 3 – Typical Clipping from a GA Site Plan\n\n![clipping-from-ga-plan](/images/Clipping-from-GA-Plan-300x289.jpg)\n\nFigure 4 – Typical General Arrangement Plan\n\n![clipping-from-ga-elevation](/images/Clipping-from-GA-Elevation-300x213.jpg)\n\nFigure 5 – Typical General Arrangement Elevation\n\n![cts-bal2a](/images/CTS-BAL2a-194x300.jpg)\n\nFigure 6 – Typical Mass Balance for a Chip Thickness Screening System\n\n## 1.9   Equipment Technical Specifications\n\nPreliminary vendor information is usually required for concept development and capital cost estimating, so equipment technical specifications and sketches must be prepared for inclusion in requests for \\[budget\\] quotations (RFQ’s).\n\nFor a definition study, the technical specifications should be as brief as possible, but as a minimum, should contain the following:\n\n-   A brief description of the project and how the specific equipment fits into the project, and a description of what the specific piece of equipment is to do.\n-   Limits of supply, including a list of the required Vendor Supply components and a list of the excluded components.\n-   Design criteria including a description of the material being handled / processed, with the target material characteristics and required flow rates.\n-   Performance requirements.\n-   Plant operating conditions and required standard components.\n-   Equipment specifications / requirements for: mechanical, piping, structural, electrical and controls.\n-   A list of the governing codes and standards that need to be met.\n\n## 1.10  Requests for Quotations\n\nRequests for quotations (RFQ’s) can be brief for definition studies, but should address the following:\n\nInstructions to Bidders\n\n-   A clear statement of the RFQ requirements; i.e. – budget pricing +/-25%.\n-   Response request; tender submission requirements and RFQ closing time.\n-   Equipment delivery timing and location.\n-   Pricing requirements; i.e. – validity, FOB, DDP, etc.\n-   Warranty and performance guarantee requirements.\n-   A list of information to be provided with the vendor’s bid package.\n\nTechnical Documents\n\nThe RFQ should contain relevant technical documents, including:\n\n-   Technical specification and associated drawings.\n-   Geotechnical information.\n-   Plant / Mill Conditions.\n\nNote: Be careful to observe all non-disclosure agreements (NDA’s) when submitting RFQ’s.\n\n## 1.11  Master Equipment Schedule / Work Breakdown Structure\n\nA preliminary master equipment schedule (MES) spreadsheet is usually developed during the definition phase, and includes a listing of all the equipment with such information as:\n\n-   Equipment name and number – The client may have a pre-existing naming and numbering system.\n-   Equipment description with capacity, etc.\n-   Motor size and speed, and load factor.\n-   Electricity voltage, phase and cycle.\n-   Sometimes control devices are included in the MES.\n\n![equipment-list-sample](/images/Equipment-List-Sample-300x194.jpg)\n\nFigure 7 – Sample Master Equipment Schedule\n\nLater in the detail design phase of the project, a work breakdown structure (WBS) is developed that becomes the governing document against which all project charges are recorded.\n\n## 1.12  Project Schedule\n\nA preliminary project schedule is developed during the definition phase. The schedule must consider:\n\n-   The plant’s target start-up date – This is usually the best place to start when developing a preliminary project schedule. Then work backwards through the necessary implementation steps to arrive at a project start date and to determine the available time for tasks.\n-   Commissioning period.\n-   Construction period including all discipline work.\n-   Equipment manufacturing and delivery times.\n-   Procurement and contracting activities.\n-   Detail engineering for all disciplines.\n-   Definition engineering.\n-   Pertinent required client milestones regarding approvals, permitting, financing, etc.\n-   Project start date.\n\nConflicts will occur that could make either the project start date or the plant start-up date unrealistic; however, many of the above activities can overlap to shorten the overall project delivery time.\n\nRefer to the following sample schedule.\n\n![sample-project-schedule](/images/Sample-Project-Schedule-300x194.jpg)\n\nFigure 8 – Typical Simple Project Schedule\n\n## 1.13  Capital Cost Estimating\n\nThe outcome of a definition study is usually a Class 25 (-15%,+25%) budget capital cost estimate (CCE) that the client can utilize in his financial modelling.\n\nA capital cost estimate should include direct costs, indirect costs and contingency; and may or may not provide for escalation.\n\nDirect Costs\n\nDirect costs are \\`hard’ project costs for each item, which include the following for each discipline:\n\n-   Direct purchase price of goods or service.\n-   Installation contractor purchases, including concrete, steel, tool rentals, sub-contractors.\n-   Contractor installation labour.\n\nIndirect Costs\n\nIndirect costs are \\`soft’ project costs that are not included in direct costs and could include allowances for such things as:\n\n-   Engineering.\n-   Owner’s project development costs.\n-   Construction management.\n-   Construction living out allowance (LOA) and travel.\n-   Temporary construction facilities.\n-   Construction insurance.\n-   Vendor equipment erection supervision.\n-   Commissioning and start-up assistance and training.\n-   Premium labour costs (overtime).\n-   Spare parts.\n-   Taxes and Duties.\n\nThe amount included for indirect costs depends upon the client’s company policies, and the items included can vary substantially, depending upon the client.  An average allowance to use is 25% of the total direct costs.\n\nContingency\n\nA contingency allowance should be provided in the CCE to cover those costs that are unforeseen at the time the estimate is produced and may become apparent as detailed design and construction proceed. The contingency is not intended to provide for costs associated with scope changes.\n\nThe amount of contingency to allow depends upon the client’s company policy, which should consider the amount of engineering and procurement work undertaken to produce the CCE and can vary between 5% and 25% of total direct and indirect costs.  The greater the project definition, the lower the contingency required.\n\nAmount of Engineering Required\n\nYou don’t want to do any more engineering than is required to satisfy the requirements of the current project development phase.  For example, you would not want to expend the effort to do complete detail design until you knew the project was technically and financially viable and you had MOU’s in place with most of the stakeholders (resource suppliers, market clients, lenders, etc.).\n\nDepending upon the project complexity, a minimum of 5-10% of the total project engineering should be completed for a definition study.  Some clients require an AFE grade Class 10 estimate at the end of the definition phase, and the amount of engineering and procurement is significantly greater at 25-35%.\n\nBudget Pricing\n\nPreliminary vendor budget pricing is required to develop a Class 25 budget capital cost estimate. Short technical specifications need to be developed and +/-25% budget pricing requested. When evaluating bids, it is recommended that you resist the urge to use the lowest priced quotation in your capital cost estimate, as that leaves you no room to maneuver when you get to the procurement stage.\n\nMaterial Take-Offs\n\nWhere vendor pricing is not available, material take-offs (MTO’s) are required to estimate the amounts of all required components including: civil works, structural foundations and steelwork, mechanical equipment, steelwork and HVAC, piping, electrical and controls.\n\nContracting Estimating\n\nIn addition to the hard equipment and material costs, the estimator must consider installation labour, contractor purchases, mobilization and demobilization, equipment rentals, straight-time and overtime labour rates.  If the estimator doesn’t have up-to-date information regarding the appropriate rates at the project location or the type of construction required, he may initiate preliminary discussions with potential contractors regarding unit pricing.\n\n![oom-costs-r4](/images/OOM-Costs-r4-232x300.jpg)\n\nFigure 9 – Sample Order of Magnitude Capital Cost Estimate\n\n## 1.14  Project Execution Plan\n\nA project execution plan should be developed during the definition phase for the project going forward defining:\n\n-   The type of project, i.e. – conventional; engineer, procure and construct (EPC) or design-build; or engineering, procurement and construction management (EPCM).\n-   A list of the required \\`actors’ in the project and their roles and responsibilities. i.e. – client, engineers, vendors, contractors.\n-   The steps necessary to efficiently implement the project.\n-   The project schedule.\n-   The engineering requirements.\n-   The procurement and contracting tasks.\n\n## 1.15  Study Report\n\nTypically, all of the above information is combined in a Project Definition Report, which is usually written by the consultant engineer with input from the client. The report is first issued to the client for review and comments and then revised to suit and reissued for the client’s files.\n\nBy the time that the definition study is complete and the report issued, the project should be well defined with few unknowns left to resolve.  The client should have high confidence in the viability (or not) of the project and that the project is ready to proceed into the detail engineering phase.\n\n# 2     Detail Engineering Phase\n\nDetail engineering follows the definition phase. During detail engineering, all necessary details required to construct the project are worked out.  The detail engineers use the definition study as their starting point and guide through the rest of the process.\n\nDetail engineering includes:\n\n-   Preparing a detailed project schedule.\n-   Confirming process design and calculations.\n-   Preparing general arrangement drawings.\n-   Preparing detail drawings sufficient for firm-price procurement and contracting purposes (all disciplines).\n-   Preparing technical specifications for equipment purchases.\n-   Reviewing vendor information.\n-   Preparing detail design drawings based on the selected vendor’s equipment.\n-   Preparing scopes of work for civil / structural contracts, mechanical / piping contracts, and electrical / instrumentation contracts.\n-   Writing a process functional specification (process narrative) and a control narrative defining the process control requirements.\n\nOften more precise information is required during detail engineering, including:\n\n-   Detailed surveys of specific locations.\n-   Geotechnical work including taking soil samples.\n-   Taking field measurements of existing equipment.\n-   Inspections of existing electrical and control systems.\n\nRegular drawing issues should be made to keep everyone informed and two design review meetings would be held at the 25% and 50% design completion points; the purpose being to give the client the opportunity to make changes before the detail design progresses too far.\n\nSite Survey\n\nA site survey is required for detail engineering; however, much of the survey information may already exist somewhere in the client’s files.\n\nIf you decide to do a survey, then get a dimensioned site plan drawing from the client and check the presence and locations of existing structures and equipment against the drawing.\n\nOther Activities\n\nThe following items are normally done during the detail engineering phase:\n\n-   Procurement activities including issuing price inquiries, preparing bid evaluations, negotiating and awarding purchases, expediting deliveries (These can be done by the client, the engineer or the contractor).\n-   Contracting activities including preparing contract documents, issuing the contracts for tender, preparing comparisons of tender, negotiating and awarding contracts (usually done by the client or engineer).\n-   Often permits are required; these are normally prepared and submitted by the client, but he usually needs project specific information provided by the engineer, in order to do so.\n-   Establishing an accounting grade, Class 10 CCE.\n\n# 3     Construction Phase\n\nConstruction often starts before detail design is complete.  The civil / structural work is started first, followed closely by mechanical / piping; electrical / instrumentation would follow some time later.\n\nSometimes the client manages the construction; sometimes he hires a third party to do so.\n\nConstruction not only includes the actual erection and installation, it also includes:\n\n-   Health, safety and environmental considerations.\n-   Scheduling.\n-   Procuring materials.\n-   Sub-contracting.\n-   Project accounting.\n-   Quality control.\n\n# 4     Commissioning and Start-Up Phase\n\nCommissioning and start-up follow construction and include:\n\n-   Rotation checks.\n-   Control and logic checks.\n-   Safety device checks.\n-   Dry running the equipment; then short runs with material.\n-   Making flow adjustments.\n-   Operational training (by client).\n-   Developing safe work procedures (client).\n-   Actual start-up and running at production levels.\n-   System performance checks.\n\n**GLOSSARY**\n\nAFE                                                                     application for expenditure\n\nCCE                                                                     capital cost estimate\n\nDBM                                                                    design basis memorandum\n\nDCS                                                                     distributed control system\n\nDDP                                                                    delivery, duty paid\n\nEPC                                                                     engineer, procure and construct\n\nEPCM                                                                  engineer, procure and construction management\n\nFEED                                                                   front-end engineering and design\n\nFEL                                                                      front-end loading\n\nFOB                                                                     free on board\n\nGA’s                                                                    general arrangement \\[drawings\\]\n\nHMI                                                                      human machine interface\n\nHVAC                                                                   heating, ventilation and air conditioning\n\nLOA                                                                     living-out allowance\n\nMC                                                                       moisture content\n\nMCC                                                                    motor control centre\n\nMES                                                                    master equipment schedule\n\nMOU                                                                    memorandum of understanding\n\nMSW                                                                    municipal solid waste\n\nMTO                                                                     material take-off\n\nNDA                                                                     non-disclosure agreement\n\nPLC                                                                     programmable logic controller\n\nPFD                                                                     process flow diagram\n\nP&C                                                                     process & control diagram\n\nP&ID                                                                    process & instrumentation diagram\n\nPSD                                                                     particle size distribution\n\nRC                                                                       roller chain\n\nRFQ                                                                     request for quotation\n\nSLD                                                                     single line diagram\n\nWBS                                                                    work breakdown schedule\n\n**Other Articles**\n\nOther articles related to project implementation can be found on this website, including:\n\n-   “So You Want to Build a Biomass Plant”\n-   “Vendor Documentation Requirements”\n-   “A Practical Guide to Metrication”\n\nCopywrite © 2016\n\n**About the Author**\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years of experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

Such ‘front-end loaded’ (FEL) projects give the client confidence in the `numbers’ and complete control of the project.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the most important phases is the Project Definition phase where the project is clearly `defined’, from both technical / process and cost / benefit perspectives.  Discussions are initiated with potential suppliers, customers, financiers, regulating bodies, environmental groups and other stakeholders; a plant location is selected; plant layouts are developed; a Class 25 capital cost estimate (CCE) is developed for the preliminary alternative(s); a final alternative is selected for development; and a plan for project execution is established.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This article focuses on the project definition engineering phase, and is written from a process mechanical perspective.

I've done a couple of rock removal studies since then and decided the article needed updating with new information.\n\nThe upsurge of interest in biomass-fired power plants in the past few years is accompanied by a corresponding increase of interest in methods for removing non-combustible, non-organics such as rocks, stones, sand and grit from woody biomass. Rock contaminated woody biomass has long been a problem, and many ways have been attempted in trying to deal with it. The methods are varied, usually depending upon the end-use to which the biomass is being put. There are some specific methods that are very successful; others more a measure of how best to accommodate the problem.\n\nFollowing is a brief description of the problems, solutions and accommodations that various biomass processing industries utilize when dealing with rocks and other non-organic contaminants in their woody biomass.\n\n## Sawmills / Panelboard Plants\n\nPrimary log breakdown facilities, such as sawmills or pulpmill woodrooms, usually remove the bark before processing. Doing so, also removes dirt and stones that have become embedded in the bark during the logging process or while being transported or stored on unpaved areas. Additionally, large rocks can be picked-up by mobile equipment when handling logs and can be dropped onto the log infeed deck, where they get carried along until they fall through openings into the waste conveyors below. The dirt and stones become concentrated in the waste stream, which is often utilized as fuel in biomass-fired energy systems.\n\nIn northern climates, other facilities such as panelboard plants utilize log ponds to thaw out or condition (soften) the logs prior to debarking, peeling, chipping or stranding. Much of the embedded dirt and stones falls off the logs in the ponds and the rest is removed during debarking.\n\n## Wood Pellet Plants\n\nThe standard for domestic wood pellets is \u003C1% of ash, which is quite low; so the wood supply to wood pellet plants must be contaminant free. Historically, the furnish for wood pellet plants has been clean, residual sawdust, wood chips or shavings from sawmills and planermills; therefore, rock or sand contamination has not been much of an issue.\n\nHowever, in the past few years there has been a huge increase in the demand for wood pellets, primarily for the subsidized, domestic European market. North America is the primary source for wood pellets, although other regions are entering the pellet supply chain.\n\nDue to the economic crash in 2008 – 2009, there was a decline in housing starts in the USA that is only now starting to recover. Fewer housing starts meant a decreased requirement for lumber and panelboard resulting in fewer residuals being produced. Concurrently, the global demand for wood pellets increased to the point where the amount of available residuals is insufficient to meet the fibre demand for pellets. These factors have resulted in a shortage of clean furnish for the manufacture of wood pellets. Consequently, pellet producers are utilizing other sources of wood fibre including standing dead wood or other non-merchantable timber with the result being that the fibre supply is often contaminated with dirt, sand and rocks.\n\nIn addition to the requirement for low-ash pellets, pelletizers are susceptible to damage and rapid wear, so rock contamination has become a big issue and solutions are being sought for eliminating rocks from the chip supply.\n\n## Pulp Mills\n\nPulp mills that utilize the Kraft pulping process have found that chips of a uniform length and thickness produce a better quality of pulp. Knots and overthick wood chunks do not 'cook' as quickly in the digesters and recirculate many times through the system taking up valuable production space. Pin chips, long toothpick shaped particles, tend to plug screens, thereby reducing production. And small particles or fines, have been found to require excess amounts of chemical to process through the recovery boilers. Consequently, pulp mills have developed sophisticated multi-stage screening systems to remove gross over-sized pieces of wood, reprocess overthick pieces, regulate the amount of pins being utilized and remove the fines.\n\nOne side-effect of the screening system has been the removal of some of the non-organic materials. Rocks larger than the primary screen openings are separated out of the main chip flow along with the overthick chips, which before being reprocessed are first passed through an air density separator (ADS) to remove the rocks which can damage the chip slicers / conditioners. Chip fines passing through the tertiary screens are also removed from the main chip flow to the digester. Sand and grit is coincidentally removed with the fines. These rejected fines are often used as fuel for biomass-fired energy systems.\n\nThermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) mills utilize mechanical refiners to reduce the wood chips to basic wood fibres. The close tolerance refiners cannot tolerate non-organics; so wood chips are first washed to remove stones and grit.\n\n## Biomass-fired Boilers\n\nRocks that are contained in the wastewood stream will be conveyed to the wastewood 'hog' (grinder) and can be smashed by the rotor hammers. Doing so can cause, at the least, rapid component wear, and at the worst, damage to the rotor and grates. The contaminated, processed hog fuel is often used as fuel for biomass-fired energy systems.\n\nMass-burn biomass boilers are fairly tolerant of non-combustible non-organics, most of which are removed with the left over bottom ash. However, large rocks can cause problems in the fuel handling system and downstream operating problems in the ash handling systems. Small stones and pebbles can get caught between the combustor's bottom grate bars causing them to jam-up and break. At the other end of the ash size scale, very fine particles of sand being carried by the flue gases can seriously abrade the pressure tubes in the boiler.\n\nBubbling fluidized bed (BFB) boilers are designed to utilize sand as an efficient medium for transferring heat to the biomass fuel and are especially effective with biomass fuels with high moisture contents. Combustion air is blown through the sand bed and the fluidized sand is mixed with the burning fuel which is quickly dried, heated and combusted. Rocks entering with the biomass fuel do not fluidize and accumulate in the bottom of the boiler; so a fraction of the fluidizing sand containing the rocks is continuously removed from the boiler bottom. Some plants screen the rejected sand to remove the rocks, clinker and fines; others simply send it to landfill. Sand entering the boiler with the biomass makes up some of the sand loss, but other new sand must be purchased to replenish the lost sand.\n\nGenerally, keeping rocks out of the biomass fuel supply reduces boiler operating downtime and lowers operating costs, particularly so for power plants, which have strict penalties for unplanned outages off the grid. The rock contamination problem is somewhat less problematic for industries that have their own cogeneration (Cogen) or combined heat and power (CHP) plants and utilize the heat and steam internally.\n\n## Contamination with Non-Organics\n\nContamination can consist of varying amounts of sand, dirt, grit, and small and large stones; and generally occurs as a result of poor handling practices, including:\n\n- Dragging felled wood along the ground where dirt and rocks can become embedded in the bark.\n- Dirt, grit and stones can build-up on transport trucks and if not properly cleaned-off, find their way into the biomass stream when the trucks are emptied at the plant.\n- Storing woody biomass on unpaved ground. Even providing for a sacrificial layer of biomass, rocks will work their way up from the underlying soil and be picked up by mobile equipment moving the biomass to the plant.\n- Picking up grit and stones when reclaiming roadside logging debris (RLD) stored on unpaved pads.\n- Not taking the requisite care with primary plant residuals; i.e. – allowing clean sawdust or chips to be mixed with 'dirty' bark.\n\nThe best method of minimizing rock contamination is to prevent the non-organics from entering the biomass flow in the first place. One pulp mill found that rocks were migrating from the unpaved chip storage yard into the chip supply, so paved the storage pad. Once the area was paved, the rock contamination problem went away. Another mill found that removing the sand, snow and small stones that fell off trucks onto the truck dumper before they could get into the chip stream solved their contamination problem.\n\nAs it is not always possible to prevent rocks from entering the biomass flow, some form of rock removal is sometimes necessary. However, trying to remove 100% of the non-organics from 100% of the material stream is costly. Before selecting a rock removal system, first determine which size range of rock particle is causing the trouble and design a system to remove it.\n\n## Rock Removal Methods\n\nEffectively removing rocks from biomass requires a lot of equipment that is costly to operate. There are a few methods of rock removal, including:\n\n### Water Bath Rock Separator\n\nMost woody biomass is lighter than water and floats; most sand and rocks are heavier and sink, which makes the water bath effective for removing heavy non-organics. So, if excess moisture in the biomass is not a process issue, a water bath can be used for removing sand, grit and rocks from ground-up biomass. The lighter, buoyant biomass floats on top of the water and can be floated off while the heavy non-organics sink to the bottom. Water baths are more suitable for separating large particles where the surface-to-mass ratio is quite low and the consequent surface water pick-up is low, as contrasted to small particles with a high surface-to-mass ratio.\n\nHowever, the water bath has serious disadvantages, including:\n\n- Moisture pick-up in the biomass, which if used as fuel in a biomass boiler causes problems in the combustor and decreases output.\n- If you operate in a very cold climate, the wet biomass can freeze into lumps.\n- The cleaning water quickly becomes contaminated and must be continually refreshed. Treating the wastewater can be costly, unless the facility already has a plant with a large wastewater treatment system.\n\n### Air Knives\n\nThe simplest rock removal system utilizes a wide high-speed belt conveyor that throws the material in a thin stream across an air gap. The trajectory is just short enough that the material won't reach the downstream conveyor without assistance, which is provided in the form of an air stream from an air knife. The air knife is an air chamber that is mounted underneath the conveyor head pulley and has a narrow slit the full-length through which low pressure, high velocity air is blown underneath the falling material. The air jet catches the lighter material and blows it across the gap onto the downstream conveyor. Heavier particles fall through the air stream into the gap and land on a rejects conveyor that transports the 'heavies' away from the main product stream.\n\nAs with all systems that utilize air, air knives work on a narrow density band, so it is best to use them on material previously classified by size.\n\nAir knives pressurize the conveyor enclosure and without dust control, fugitive dusting is an issue.\n\n### Air Density Separation (ADS)\n\nThere are many systems available that utilize air streams to separate particles by size and density. Typically the lighter particles are carried in the air stream and the heavier particles fall-out of the air stream. These systems work well, but their big disadvantage is that they are only effective over a narrow density band where the particles are similar in size. This necessitates separating the material into different sized particle streams before treating each stream over an air density separation (ADS) system custom designed for that particle size. Dust control is required to meet emission standards.\n\nHigh capacity air density separation systems utilize high volume, low pressure air to separate heavies from lights. A fan produces a negative pressure in a cyclone, which draws air up through a pipe connected to a separation chamber. A rotary feeder meters the material into the up-flowing airstream inside the separation chamber. The 'heavies' fall out the bottom of the chamber and the 'lights' are carried up the air pipe into the cyclone, which separates the material from the air stream. A rotary airlock discharges the collected 'light' material from the bottom of the cyclone. The cleaned material is conveyed away for further processing.\n\nADS systems are custom designed for specific particle sizes and material densities, and can be adjusted during operation for different flows and separation classifications. ADS systems are used in pulpmill chip thickness screening systems for removing heavies such as rocks and knots from the chip flow prior to a chip slicer / conditioner.\n\nAir density separation (ADS) systems are effective at rock removal, but also have disadvantages, including:\n\n- A large piece of wood can weigh more than a small pebble, so ADS systems effectively work only over a small range of densities, where the particles are similar in size.\n- Large volumes of air are required, resulting in large fans and motors.\n- Effective air clean-up systems are required that will meet emission standards.\n- ADS rock removal systems usually require a considerable amount of equipment, require large supporting structures, have a big footprint and are costly to construct and operate.\n\n### Screening for Size and ADS\n\nIf only one particular size of rock is causing problems, screen-out that size of particle and discard it. However, you will also be discarding similar sized particles of biomass, which may or may not be acceptable.\n\nGenerally, I have found that a combination of screening for size and air density separation is the best dry method of removing rock particles from biomass. First screen the entire product flow into different size classifications, one or more of which will contain the offending rock particle size. Then process the selected contaminated stream through an appropriately designed air density separator to separate the biomass from the heavier non-organics.\n\nIn most cases it is fairly easy and not too costly to retrofit a rock removal system into industrial processes that already utilize multi-levels of size screening, as many of the required components are already in place.\n\nOne example is a pulp mill that discovered that rocks 1/4\" – 3/8\" were causing substantial wear to the pulp screens. This mill already had (3) levels of chip size screening in place for other process purposes. It was found that most rocks larger than 3/8\" were being removed by the primary screen and overthick ADS system; and sand and grit smaller than 1/8\" were being removed by the tertiary screen. But rocks between 1/8\" and 3/8\" were staying in the chip flow to the pulp mill digester. It was also found that these sizes of rocks were concentrated in the chip flow from the secondary to tertiary chip screens; consequently, it was recommended that this contaminated stream be diverted off-line to an ADS system where the rocks could be removed.\n\n### Fluidization and Vibration\n\nSome rock removal systems utilize a combination of fluidization and vibration to separate lights and heavies. The equipment consists of an inclined, perforated, vibrating fluidization plate. Air is pumped into a chamber underneath the plate and escapes upwards through the perforations, the intent being to fluidize the material on top. Material is fed onto the center of the plate; the fluidized light material floats downwards off the sloped plate and the heavies are vibrated off the upper end of the plate.\n\nSuch systems that utilize fluidization and vibration work best with low flows of uniformly sized and shaped material. To our knowledge such a system has not been utilized on wastewood.\n\n### Screening, Vibration, Fluidization and Air Knives\n\nThis combination of processes is best demonstrated by the vibrating destoner, which is specifically designed for removing rocks from biomass and comes in several configurations. The basic machine is a vibrating conveyor with one or more integral air knives operating in a similar fashion to the air knife described above.\n\nA perforated plate is located in the bottom of the vibrating pan just before the air-knife, which is located underneath an opening in the bottom of the vibrating pan. Low pressure air is blown into a chamber below the perforated plate and escapes upward through the perforations, the intent being to loosen and fluidize the light material just before it falls over the edge of the air-knife opening.\n\nAir is blown into the air knife which has a narrow slit the full-length. High velocity air from the air knife blows the light material across the gap onto the downstream vibrating pan. Heavies fall through the gap into a chute and out the side of the vibrating conveyor.

I’ve done a couple of rock removal studies since then and decided the article needed updating with new information.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The upsurge of interest in biomass-fired power plants in the past few years is accompanied by a corresponding increase of interest in methods for removing non-combustible, non-organics such as rocks, stones, sand and grit from woody biomass. Rock contaminated woody biomass has long been a problem, and many ways have been attempted in trying to deal with it. The methods are varied, usually depending upon the end-use to which the biomass is being put. There are some specific methods that are very successful; others more a measure of how best to accommodate the problem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Following is a brief description of the problems, solutions and accommodations that various biomass processing industries utilize when dealing with rocks and other non-organic contaminants in their woody biomass.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"sawmills--panelboard-plants\">Sawmills / Panelboard Plants\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Primary log breakdown facilities, such as sawmills or pulpmill woodrooms, usually remove the bark before processing. Doing so, also removes dirt and stones that have become embedded in the bark during the logging process or while being transported or stored on unpaved areas. Additionally, large rocks can be picked-up by mobile equipment when handling logs and can be dropped onto the log infeed deck, where they get carried along until they fall through openings into the waste conveyors below. The dirt and stones become concentrated in the waste stream, which is often utilized as fuel in biomass-fired energy systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In northern climates, other facilities such as panelboard plants utilize log ponds to thaw out or condition (soften) the logs prior to debarking, peeling, chipping or stranding. Much of the embedded dirt and stones falls off the logs in the ponds and the rest is removed during debarking.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"wood-pellet-plants\">Wood Pellet Plants\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The standard for domestic wood pellets is &#x3C;1% of ash, which is quite low; so the wood supply to wood pellet plants must be contaminant free. Historically, the furnish for wood pellet plants has been clean, residual sawdust, wood chips or shavings from sawmills and planermills; therefore, rock or sand contamination has not been much of an issue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, in the past few years there has been a huge increase in the demand for wood pellets, primarily for the subsidized, domestic European market. North America is the primary source for wood pellets, although other regions are entering the pellet supply chain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Due to the economic crash in 2008 – 2009, there was a decline in housing starts in the USA that is only now starting to recover. Fewer housing starts meant a decreased requirement for lumber and panelboard resulting in fewer residuals being produced. Concurrently, the global demand for wood pellets increased to the point where the amount of available residuals is insufficient to meet the fibre demand for pellets. These factors have resulted in a shortage of clean furnish for the manufacture of wood pellets. Consequently, pellet producers are utilizing other sources of wood fibre including standing dead wood or other non-merchantable timber with the result being that the fibre supply is often contaminated with dirt, sand and rocks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In addition to the requirement for low-ash pellets, pelletizers are susceptible to damage and rapid wear, so rock contamination has become a big issue and solutions are being sought for eliminating rocks from the chip supply.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"pulp-mills\">Pulp Mills\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Pulp mills that utilize the Kraft pulping process have found that chips of a uniform length and thickness produce a better quality of pulp. Knots and overthick wood chunks do not ‘cook’ as quickly in the digesters and recirculate many times through the system taking up valuable production space. Pin chips, long toothpick shaped particles, tend to plug screens, thereby reducing production. And small particles or fines, have been found to require excess amounts of chemical to process through the recovery boilers. Consequently, pulp mills have developed sophisticated multi-stage screening systems to remove gross over-sized pieces of wood, reprocess overthick pieces, regulate the amount of pins being utilized and remove the fines.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One side-effect of the screening system has been the removal of some of the non-organic materials. Rocks larger than the primary screen openings are separated out of the main chip flow along with the overthick chips, which before being reprocessed are first passed through an air density separator (ADS) to remove the rocks which can damage the chip slicers / conditioners. Chip fines passing through the tertiary screens are also removed from the main chip flow to the digester. Sand and grit is coincidentally removed with the fines. These rejected fines are often used as fuel for biomass-fired energy systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) mills utilize mechanical refiners to reduce the wood chips to basic wood fibres. The close tolerance refiners cannot tolerate non-organics; so wood chips are first washed to remove stones and grit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"biomass-fired-boilers\">Biomass-fired Boilers\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Rocks that are contained in the wastewood stream will be conveyed to the wastewood ‘hog’ (grinder) and can be smashed by the rotor hammers. Doing so can cause, at the least, rapid component wear, and at the worst, damage to the rotor and grates. The contaminated, processed hog fuel is often used as fuel for biomass-fired energy systems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mass-burn biomass boilers are fairly tolerant of non-combustible non-organics, most of which are removed with the left over bottom ash. However, large rocks can cause problems in the fuel handling system and downstream operating problems in the ash handling systems. Small stones and pebbles can get caught between the combustor’s bottom grate bars causing them to jam-up and break. At the other end of the ash size scale, very fine particles of sand being carried by the flue gases can seriously abrade the pressure tubes in the boiler.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) boilers are designed to utilize sand as an efficient medium for transferring heat to the biomass fuel and are especially effective with biomass fuels with high moisture contents. Combustion air is blown through the sand bed and the fluidized sand is mixed with the burning fuel which is quickly dried, heated and combusted. Rocks entering with the biomass fuel do not fluidize and accumulate in the bottom of the boiler; so a fraction of the fluidizing sand containing the rocks is continuously removed from the boiler bottom. Some plants screen the rejected sand to remove the rocks, clinker and fines; others simply send it to landfill. Sand entering the boiler with the biomass makes up some of the sand loss, but other new sand must be purchased to replenish the lost sand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Generally, keeping rocks out of the biomass fuel supply reduces boiler operating downtime and lowers operating costs, particularly so for power plants, which have strict penalties for unplanned outages off the grid. The rock contamination problem is somewhat less problematic for industries that have their own cogeneration (Cogen) or combined heat and power (CHP) plants and utilize the heat and steam internally.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"contamination-with-non-organics\">Contamination with Non-Organics\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Contamination can consist of varying amounts of sand, dirt, grit, and small and large stones; and generally occurs as a result of poor handling practices, including:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Dragging felled wood along the ground where dirt and rocks can become embedded in the bark.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Dirt, grit and stones can build-up on transport trucks and if not properly cleaned-off, find their way into the biomass stream when the trucks are emptied at the plant.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Storing woody biomass on unpaved ground. Even providing for a sacrificial layer of biomass, rocks will work their way up from the underlying soil and be picked up by mobile equipment moving the biomass to the plant.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Picking up grit and stones when reclaiming roadside logging debris (RLD) stored on unpaved pads.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Not taking the requisite care with primary plant residuals; i.e. – allowing clean sawdust or chips to be mixed with ‘dirty’ bark.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The best method of minimizing rock contamination is to prevent the non-organics from entering the biomass flow in the first place. One pulp mill found that rocks were migrating from the unpaved chip storage yard into the chip supply, so paved the storage pad. Once the area was paved, the rock contamination problem went away. Another mill found that removing the sand, snow and small stones that fell off trucks onto the truck dumper before they could get into the chip stream solved their contamination problem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As it is not always possible to prevent rocks from entering the biomass flow, some form of rock removal is sometimes necessary. However, trying to remove 100% of the non-organics from 100% of the material stream is costly. Before selecting a rock removal system, first determine which size range of rock particle is causing the trouble and design a system to remove it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"rock-removal-methods\">Rock Removal Methods\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Effectively removing rocks from biomass requires a lot of equipment that is costly to operate. There are a few methods of rock removal, including:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"water-bath-rock-separator\">Water Bath Rock Separator\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Most woody biomass is lighter than water and floats; most sand and rocks are heavier and sink, which makes the water bath effective for removing heavy non-organics. So, if excess moisture in the biomass is not a process issue, a water bath can be used for removing sand, grit and rocks from ground-up biomass. The lighter, buoyant biomass floats on top of the water and can be floated off while the heavy non-organics sink to the bottom. Water baths are more suitable for separating large particles where the surface-to-mass ratio is quite low and the consequent surface water pick-up is low, as contrasted to small particles with a high surface-to-mass ratio.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, the water bath has serious disadvantages, including:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Moisture pick-up in the biomass, which if used as fuel in a biomass boiler causes problems in the combustor and decreases output.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>If you operate in a very cold climate, the wet biomass can freeze into lumps.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The cleaning water quickly becomes contaminated and must be continually refreshed. Treating the wastewater can be costly, unless the facility already has a plant with a large wastewater treatment system.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"air-knives\">Air Knives\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The simplest rock removal system utilizes a wide high-speed belt conveyor that throws the material in a thin stream across an air gap. The trajectory is just short enough that the material won’t reach the downstream conveyor without assistance, which is provided in the form of an air stream from an air knife. The air knife is an air chamber that is mounted underneath the conveyor head pulley and has a narrow slit the full-length through which low pressure, high velocity air is blown underneath the falling material. The air jet catches the lighter material and blows it across the gap onto the downstream conveyor. Heavier particles fall through the air stream into the gap and land on a rejects conveyor that transports the ‘heavies’ away from the main product stream.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As with all systems that utilize air, air knives work on a narrow density band, so it is best to use them on material previously classified by size.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Air knives pressurize the conveyor enclosure and without dust control, fugitive dusting is an issue.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"air-density-separation-ads\">Air Density Separation (ADS)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>There are many systems available that utilize air streams to separate particles by size and density. Typically the lighter particles are carried in the air stream and the heavier particles fall-out of the air stream. These systems work well, but their big disadvantage is that they are only effective over a narrow density band where the particles are similar in size. This necessitates separating the material into different sized particle streams before treating each stream over an air density separation (ADS) system custom designed for that particle size. Dust control is required to meet emission standards.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>High capacity air density separation systems utilize high volume, low pressure air to separate heavies from lights. A fan produces a negative pressure in a cyclone, which draws air up through a pipe connected to a separation chamber. A rotary feeder meters the material into the up-flowing airstream inside the separation chamber. The ‘heavies’ fall out the bottom of the chamber and the ‘lights’ are carried up the air pipe into the cyclone, which separates the material from the air stream. A rotary airlock discharges the collected ‘light’ material from the bottom of the cyclone. The cleaned material is conveyed away for further processing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>ADS systems are custom designed for specific particle sizes and material densities, and can be adjusted during operation for different flows and separation classifications. ADS systems are used in pulpmill chip thickness screening systems for removing heavies such as rocks and knots from the chip flow prior to a chip slicer / conditioner.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Air density separation (ADS) systems are effective at rock removal, but also have disadvantages, including:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>A large piece of wood can weigh more than a small pebble, so ADS systems effectively work only over a small range of densities, where the particles are similar in size.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Large volumes of air are required, resulting in large fans and motors.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Effective air clean-up systems are required that will meet emission standards.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>ADS rock removal systems usually require a considerable amount of equipment, require large supporting structures, have a big footprint and are costly to construct and operate.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"screening-for-size-and-ads\">Screening for Size and ADS\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>If only one particular size of rock is causing problems, screen-out that size of particle and discard it. However, you will also be discarding similar sized particles of biomass, which may or may not be acceptable.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Generally, I have found that a combination of screening for size and air density separation is the best dry method of removing rock particles from biomass. First screen the entire product flow into different size classifications, one or more of which will contain the offending rock particle size. Then process the selected contaminated stream through an appropriately designed air density separator to separate the biomass from the heavier non-organics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In most cases it is fairly easy and not too costly to retrofit a rock removal system into industrial processes that already utilize multi-levels of size screening, as many of the required components are already in place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One example is a pulp mill that discovered that rocks 1/4” – 3/8” were causing substantial wear to the pulp screens. This mill already had (3) levels of chip size screening in place for other process purposes. It was found that most rocks larger than 3/8” were being removed by the primary screen and overthick ADS system; and sand and grit smaller than 1/8” were being removed by the tertiary screen. But rocks between 1/8” and 3/8” were staying in the chip flow to the pulp mill digester. It was also found that these sizes of rocks were concentrated in the chip flow from the secondary to tertiary chip screens; consequently, it was recommended that this contaminated stream be diverted off-line to an ADS system where the rocks could be removed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"fluidization-and-vibration\">Fluidization and Vibration\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Some rock removal systems utilize a combination of fluidization and vibration to separate lights and heavies. The equipment consists of an inclined, perforated, vibrating fluidization plate. Air is pumped into a chamber underneath the plate and escapes upwards through the perforations, the intent being to fluidize the material on top. Material is fed onto the center of the plate; the fluidized light material floats downwards off the sloped plate and the heavies are vibrated off the upper end of the plate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Such systems that utilize fluidization and vibration work best with low flows of uniformly sized and shaped material. To our knowledge such a system has not been utilized on wastewood.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"screening-vibration-fluidization-and-air-knives\">Screening, Vibration, Fluidization and Air Knives\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This combination of processes is best demonstrated by the vibrating destoner, which is specifically designed for removing rocks from biomass and comes in several configurations. The basic machine is a vibrating conveyor with one or more integral air knives operating in a similar fashion to the air knife described above.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A perforated plate is located in the bottom of the vibrating pan just before the air-knife, which is located underneath an opening in the bottom of the vibrating pan. Low pressure air is blown into a chamber below the perforated plate and escapes upward through the perforations, the intent being to loosen and fluidize the light material just before it falls over the edge of the air-knife opening.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Air is blown into the air knife which has a narrow slit the full-length. High velocity air from the air knife blows the light material across the gap onto the downstream vibrating pan. Heavies fall through the gap into a chute and out the side of the vibrating conveyor. Multiple air-knives can be installed in a destoner to provide different classifications.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The destoner is also available with a vibrating screen section for providing a secondary size classification. Material smaller than the screen opening falls through the screen onto a second vibrating deck and is either discharged from the machine or carried to a second destoner air knife.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Destoners work best where the particle size is fairly uniform and the flow is metered onto the destoner presenting an even depth of burden (DOB) to the air knife.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The inside of the destoner is under a positive pressure from the fluidizing air / air knife fan(s).

For example, temperatures in northern Canada can vary between -45°C in winter to +35°C in summer. In winter, snow load, blowing snow and ice build-up are always problems to be encountered. The product being handled can have ice particles frozen to it and can also contain loose snow. And at such extreme temperatures, steel becomes very brittle and susceptible to damage from impacts.\n\nIn warmer climates, you can push the design limits and use short, steep, small, high speed conveyors. In extreme cold climates, simultaneously pushing all design limits is a recipe for disaster.\n\nIn extreme cold climates it's best to be conservative in your design. Following is a list of 'do's and don'ts, which I have learned over the years.\n\n## Special Design Considerations for Cold Climate Conveyors\n\nYou can expect that product which is stored in open storage piles will be covered with snow for much of the year. Unless the snow is scraped off, conveyors should be sized for handling the additional amounts of loose snow anticipated being reclaimed with the product. Also, expect frozen lumps to come off the pile. If there is no scalping screen or lump breaker ahead of the conveyor, design your chutes and skirtboards to handle the largest frozen lump.\n\nThe load on the conveyor should be kept lower than normal to increase belt to product contact and the speed should be kept fairly slow; this will result in a wider than normal belt.\n\nTransitioning from one conveyor to another requires special care to give the frozen and slippery product time to reaccelerate. To ease the transfer of material from one conveyor to another, limit the conveyor slope in the loading zone to \u003C8°. Limit the maximum conveyor slope to 12° and avoid across-the-line starting in order to prevent material slide-back when restarting a loaded belt. I prefer electrical soft-starts as they are not affected by temperature and are easily adjustable. Additionally, maintenance can be done in warm electrical rooms as opposed to maintaining a fluid coupling out in the cold. Generous vertical concave curve radii are recommended.\n\nIf you can't avoid conveyor slopes above 12°, consider using belts with positive, vulcanized multi-cleats. Be aware that cleated belts are not easy to clean and can exacerbate fugitive dusting problems.\n\nGrooved belts with 'negative' cleats have been tried, but are not that effective handling frozen materials with snow.\n\nIf slide-back is an issue on existing conveyors, you may choose to use de-icing chemicals, which can be sprayed or dripped onto the belt. De-icing systems are costly and should be installed only as a retrofit.\n\n## Material and Component Selection\n\nUse belting designed for extreme low temperatures; those which retain their flexibility and won't crack.\n\nAvoid high alloy steel shafts. It's best to stay with large diameter, low carbon shafts.\n\nUse lubricants designed for the extreme temperature variation. Under extreme cold temperatures, viscosity should not increase to the point that grease and oils solidify; they must remain fluid. Also, at extreme warm temperatures, the lubricants should not thin-out to the point where they are no longer lubricating.\n\n## Thermal Expansion and Structural Considerations\n\nExtraordinary expansion and contraction can be expected with extreme temperature ranges and must be accommodated in the design of conveyors and structures. For example, a 500 ft conveyor will expand and contract approximately 5.5\" with a temperature range of -45° to +35°C. Conveyors and structures must have a sufficient quantity of expansion joints, properly placed to accommodate this extreme expansion and contraction.\n\nAvoid having a long conveyor, which is mostly outdoors, from entering a warm, moist building; otherwise, moisture will condense and freeze on the cold conveyor. It is better to have the transfer occur outside the heated building onto the tail-end of a warm conveyor that is mostly inside the heated building.\n\n## Enclosure and Protection\n\nConveyors should be covered to prevent material blowing off the belt. However, it is recommended that conveyors be carried inside enclosed galleries. At extreme cold temperatures, even a slight breeze can cause frostbite in just a few seconds. If working conditions are poor, equipment will not be maintained.\n\nIt is recommended that the bottom of the gallery underneath the belt be kept open to permit snow and dust to fall free from the return belt. You don't want snow and dust to build-up inside the gallery; not only is it hard to remove, but it can result in a serious structural overload condition. The amount of snow and dust falling off return idlers can be substantial, so provide lots of space under conveyors for clean-up access.\n\n## Safety and Access\n\nAccess on frozen, snow covered surfaces can be treacherous. Use stairs and avoid ladders wherever possible. Use safety-grip grating on walkways and platforms. Northern areas have very short days, so provide good lighting along conveyors.\n\n## Heating Considerations\n\nAvoid heating equipment or low occupancy structures to the point where the product will thaw out. Not only is heating costly, but there is a danger of the material re-freezing. There is a tendency to apply heat to chutework which is susceptible to freezing. This is not a good thing to do; all you will succeed in doing is increasing the freezing problem by moving it further downstream. Experience has shown that the worst seasons for conveying moisture laden materials that will freeze are the Spring and Fall 'shoulder' seasons, where temperatures are +/-5° C.\n\n## Drive and Cleaning Systems\n\nUse drive pulleys with large diameters and vulcanized diamond-shaped lagging or ceramic lagging to increase traction. Snub pulleys are recommended to increase belt wrap.\n\nAvoid using belt brush cleaners; they will immediately fill up with snow and dust. Two sets of carbide-tipped belt scrapers are recommended for scraping frozen snow and dust off the belt. There will be a lot of snow dust coming off the scrapers, so provide a lot of room underneath the scrapers inside the head chute.\n\nRaised-cleat belts are hard to clean; conventional belt scrapers cannot be used. Recently, a 'finger' type of belt cleaner has been introduced that is claimed to do a good job of cleaning cleated belts.\n\nAnother effective way to clean cleated belts is to use a properly designed and applied air-knife; but these also contribute to fugitive dusting.\n\nA 'thumper' roll just behind the head chute can be used to shake the frozen snow and dust off the return belt.\n\n## Chute Design\n\nSnow and dust will stick to almost any surface; therefore, use steep chute angles and large radius corners between chute plates. If possible, line chute plates with UHMW PE or PTFE plastic, to which ice and snow don't readily stick.\n\n## Dust Control Systems\n\nIf dust control is part of the material handling system, recognize that the amount of airborne 'dust' to be handled will be many times greater in the winter; snow crystals will be loosened from the product and sucked into the dust pick-ups. If possible, avoid baghouses as they can become clogged with packed snow. High efficiency cyclones are less prone to plugging.\n\n## Additional Cold Weather Considerations\n\nSpace pre-tensioned safety pullcord switches closer together than normal to minimize the effect of pullcord contraction / expansion causing nuisance trips.\n\nIf fire protection is required, you must take special care with the design. Dry sprinkler systems are required. Keep the size of sprinkler zones small, so that if one is activated you don't have a huge area to drain before it can freeze. Heat or flame detection is recommended.\n\nIf the conveyor system utilizes belt weigh scales, plan on recalibrating them at least twice yearly; once in the winter and again in the summer.\n\n## Special Considerations for Biomass\n\nMost of my experience has been with biomass handling systems, primarily woody biomass in all its myriad forms. However, I believe that many of the above comments are applicable to the conveying of other materials in extreme northern climates.\n\nBiomass is particularly hard to handle; it is inherently wet and therefore freezes. The particle size is rarely uniform. Biomass tends to 'knit' together and generally doesn't flow well, particularly when packed with snow.\n\nFrozen wood chips are brittle and readily break up on impact into smaller particles, which is a concern for certain processes; so limiting product speed is important.\n\nBiomass can contain contaminants, which may normally be removed by screening; however, during the winter, dirt and grit can freeze and stick to the wood chip particles. Special cleaning systems may be required.\n\nWhen handling biomass, the material density can vary widely depending upon the form of the biomass and the moisture content. Determine the amount of 'bone dry' fibre needed for the process and the density range; then use the lowest density for volumetric calculations and sizing the conveyor. For power and strength calculations, use the highest density. Be sure to allow extra capacity for the handling of loose snow.\n\n## Final Recommendations\n\nIt is recognized that not all of the above recommendations can always be accommodated, particularly those to do with conveyor geometry. For example, sometimes you have no option but to use conveyors steeper than recommended.\n\nAlso, budget concerns can exert pressure on design features such as using open galleries or minimizing length, which has the disadvantage of increasing slope; or running conveyors faster to minimize the size.\n\nI want to acknowledge that many installations are not constructed as I have described, and work satisfactorily. Every installation is unique, and all conditions must be considered; but if you have the real estate and the budget and if you follow the above rough guidelines, you will not likely have undue conveying problems.\n\n*Copyright © 2010*\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years of experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

This article is intended to provide general screen selection information based on the author's experience as to what types of screens work best with different forms of woody biomass.\n\nI've said this many times before and I will repeat it once again. \"Biomass is not an easy material to handle. It appears in a myriad of species, forms and sizes; it knits together, doesn't flow well, consolidates and packs easily. It can have a wide range of moisture contents, basic and bulk densities and calorific values. It will freeze; is very dusty, catches fire easily and is self-combustible. It can contain all manner of contaminants. On the other hand, wood pellets are uniform in size and moisture content, are very free flowing, but are quite fragile and easily degrade and require special handling.\"\n\nAll of the particular material characteristics of the specific woody biomass being processed must be taken into consideration when choosing an appropriate screen. Also, one must consider the conditions under which the screen will be operating; the quantity of material to be processed, the location, temperature, moisture, and operating hours will all have an impact on the screen effectiveness and must be considered when selecting a screen. Additionally, the intent of the screening function must be considered. What is the purpose of the screen; is it to scalp off gross oversized material, remove fines, screen for thickness, or separate into several classifications for other process considerations?\n\nThere are a lot of screen types available and most of them have been tried at one time or another on woody biomass. One type of screen may work well in one circumstance or location but not be effective in another. There are some basic types that have proven to work well if properly applied.\n\n## Disc Screens\n\nThe disc type of screen consists of a set of rotating, parallel shafts mounted in a steel frame and on which are mounted profiled, steel discs. The discs on one shaft interface with the discs on the next shaft. The spacing between the shafts, called the slot length (SL), and the space between interlaced discs, called the interface opening (IFO) can be selected to provide the desired screen open area through which material can pass. Material is fed onto the end of the screen, and is carried along the tops of the rotating discs. The profiled discs jostle the material; particles smaller than the screen opening fall through between the discs and shafts and particles larger than the screen openings are carried over the end of the disc screen. The width, length, number of shaft assemblies and the disc spacings are selected based on the quantity of material to be handled and on the target size of the material being accepted or rejected. Disc screens can have multiple screen opening sizes along the length, in order to do multiple classifications. The disc profiles can be different depending upon the material being handled. Discs should be fabricated from an abrasion resistant steel. Shaft rotational speeds are quite low, 30-40 rpm.\n\nDisc screens are often equipped with an automatic, anti-jam system. Should load sensors or speed switches sense that the screen is jammed or is slowing down, the drive will stop, reverse for a few seconds, then re-start in the forward direction. If still jammed, this sequence will be repeated 2-4 times and if still jammed, then the drive will shut down, and a person will have to inspect the machine and un-jam it, if required.\n\nMost disc screens are used as 'scalping' screens, where the prime function is to remove gross over-sized pieces of material. They are usually the very first screen in a conveying / screening system. Another function for disc screens is to be used as an 'unloading' screen before a 'hog' or grinder, the intent being to remove particles smaller than the hogged material target size, thereby bypassing and unloading the hog.\n\nIf used for handling wastewood or 'hog fuel', disc screens can be exposed to a considerable amount of contaminants including: sand, grit, dirt, rocks, snow, ice, metal and frozen lumps. So, they must be of heavy duty construction with abrasion resistant steel discs.\n\nA unique style of disc screen is the star screen, which utilizes polyurethane, star shaped discs on shafts that rotate at a much higher speed than a conventional steel disc screen and are intended to break apart and separate light, stringy materials.\n\nThere are a lot of disc screen manufacturers; some have great disc screens but unfortunately many manufacturers have not mastered the subtleties of disc screen design. The best disc screens are manufactured by: Jeffrey-Rader, Acrowood, and West Salem Machinery, among others.\n\n## Gyratory Screens\n\nThe gyratory screen consists of a box frame with one or more screen plates mounted one above the other. The inclined box frame is suspended from articulated shaft hangers that permit the screen frame to oscillate in a horizontal plane when the counterweighted drive is running.\n\nMaterial is fed onto the upper end of the sloped screen; the oscillating motion causes the material to slide down the sloped surface of the screen plates, with the under-sized material falling through the screen holes and the over-sized material being retained on top and discharging over the end of the screen.\n\nGyratory screens can have multiple screen plate 'decks' where material falls through one screen onto a second screen with smaller openings. A typical sawmill wood chip screen would have a top screen with 45mm round holes (RH), possibly a middle 13-16 mm RH screen, and a bottom 3-5 mm screen. 'Gross overs' passing over the end of the top screen would be directed to a re-chipper. The middle screen is usually intended to simply unload the bottom screen to permit more effective fines screening. 'Accepts' retained on the middle and bottom screens would be diverted to the accept chip stream. 'Fines' rejected through the bottom screen plate would be directed to the fines stream and used either for fuel or in a secondary process such as panelboard manufacturing.\n\nScreen plates can be the punched plate or woven wire mesh type depending upon the material being handled and the desired classification.\n\nThere are many different gyratory screen configurations, with end-feed or center-feed, end or bottom discharge, or counter-flow screens where the inlet and discharge are at the same end.\n\nGyratory screens have a large capacity per unit area as compared to other types of screens and generally use less power. The oscillation frequency at approximately 200 – 300 rpm is much lower, the stroke at 1.5″ – 2″ is much greater and the screen slope at 5° – 10° is much lower than that of vibrating screens. Support structures need to be 'tuned' to accommodate the horizontal frequency, particularly when supporting multiple screens. The gyratory action is much easier to accommodate from a structural perspective than the high speed vibrations common to vibratory screens.\n\nBecause of the sliding motion of the material as it moves down the surface of the screen plates, gyratory screens handle the material quite gently as compared to other styles of screens. However, because of their gentleness, gyratory screens are susceptible to 'blinding' when handling snow-laden wood chips or chips with high pitch content. To compensate, gyratory screens can be equipped with 'ball-decks' under the screen plate. The bouncing balls will bang against the underside of the screen plate and knock the blinding material off the screen. However, the balls will wear away, so the downstream process must be capable of rejecting or handling the small particles of ball material.\n\nGyratory screens are used in many industries, but are the most common screen in sawmills, planermills, panelboard plants, and pulp and paper mills. They are particularly good for handling chips, sawdust, shavings, wood strands or wood pellets.\n\nThe world leader in gyratory screen design is BM&M Screening Solutions; however, both Acrowood and West Salem make good gyratory screens, too.\n\n## Vibrating Screens\n\nThe vibrating screen consists of an inclined box frame fitted with one or more woven wire mesh screens mounted one above the other. The screen frame is usually supported on coil springs and is driven by a counterweighted electric motor, producing vertical oscillations. The vibration frequency at 800 – 1000 rpm is significantly higher, the stroke much shorter at 1/4″ – 3/8″ and the decline angle at 15° – 20° is much steeper than that of gyratory screens. Support structures need to be 'tuned' to accommodate the vertical vibrations.\n\nOscillating in the vertical plane, vibrating screens accelerate the material particles until they become airborne and then fall further down the inclined screen mesh. Material smaller than the screen mesh passes through the screen, with larger material being retained on top of the screen and discharging over the end of the screen. Vibrating screens are useful where aggressive screening action is required, such as to loosen small frozen lumps of sawdust.\n\nVibrating screens were used for decades in the forest products industry until high capacity gyratory screens were introduced. Disadvantages of the vibrating screen include:\n\n- Airborne slivers fall narrow end down and become wedged into the screen mesh.\n- Screens break due to the high frequency.\n- High maintenance costs.\n- High noise.\n\nIf aggressive screening is required, consideration should be given to the 'flip-flow' screen.\n\n## Flip-Flow Screens\n\nFlip-Flow screens consist of multiple, perforated, flexible, polyurethane screen panels that are mounted on two steel frames that move contrary to each other. As they move, the screen panels are alternately stretched and relaxed. As they are stretched, they impart very high, vertical 'g-forces' to the material on the screen, launching it into the air. The screen declination varies depending upon the material being handled, but is approximately 20° for wood chips. As with other screens, Flip-Flow screens can have multiple screen decks for different size classifications.\n\nMaterial is fed onto the upper end of the sloped screen and the alternating stretching and relaxing of the screen panels causes the airborne material to bounce down the screen. Particles smaller than the screen openings fall through the screen panels, while larger particles are retained on the top of the screen panels pass over the end of the screen.\n\nDue to the high 'g-forces' imparted to the particles, Flip-flow screens are very good at processing cohesive materials that are frozen or stuck together. And, as the polyurethane panels are stretched and relaxed, the openings are also stretched and relaxed, resulting in a screen that never blinds.\n\nFlip-flow screens require much more power to drive than other machines of comparable capacity. They are very heavy duty and are costly. It is paramount that large sharp objects be kept out of the feed to the Flip-Flow screen in order to avoid damaging the polyurethane panels. Although the screen is mounted on isolation pads, the large mass and high vibration forces quite often necessitate separate support structures that go completely down to grade, so as to not impart unsuitable vibrations to the surrounding equipment or building.\n\nFlip-Flow screens work especially well as secondary / tertiary chip screens in pulp and paper mills in extreme northern climates that have a lot of snow. The best Flip-Flow screen is the Liwell screen manufactured by Hein, Lehmann.\n\n## Trommel Screens\n\nTrommel screens have cylindrical steel frameworks in which woven wire mesh screens are fastened. The screen drum lies on its side at a slight angle (2° – 8°) and has fixed steel tires that rotate on trunnion wheels. Material is fed into the upper end of the drum and as the drum rotates, the material tends to ride up the side of the drum until it falls back to the bottom. Agitated particles smaller than the screen mesh opening fall through the screen, while larger particles are carried along the bottom internal surface of the screen drum and eventually are discharged out the end of the drum. Trommel screens can be equipped with multiple sizes of screens to produce various size classifications. Depending upon the application, trommel screens can be equipped with internal 'lifters' or spirals to help move the material along the drum bottom.\n\nAs the amount of screen actually in contact with the material is quite low, trommel screens tend to be quite large compared to other screens of similar capacity. Long slivers tend to jam in the screen openings, resulting in the need for frequent cleaning. Trommel screens will handle a lot of abuse and are generally low cost, vibration free, and produce low noise.\n\nTrommel screens are often used on tough, dirty applications such as logyard clean-up, composting plants or municipal solid waste (MSW) plants. There are many manufacturers of trommel screens.\n\n## Grizzly Screens\n\nGrizzly screens consist of declined parallel bars. Material is fed onto the upper end of the screen and material narrower than the bar spacing falls through the bars with the larger material sliding down the bars and off the lower end of the screen. In order for the large particles to flow down the screen, static grizzly screens are quite steep, >20°. Vibrating grizzly screens can have a lower slope resulting in a longer retention time and a more efficient screen.\n\nGrizzly screens are often used prior to and in conjunction with trommel screens to remove the gross oversized material that could jam or damage the trommel screens.\n\nA passive form of grizzly screen utilizes screen plates with tapered, angular slots mounted in the bottom of chain conveyors. As the chain flights move material over the slots, material smaller than the slots will fall through. Such a screen is used for rough screening out small particles such as fines, sand and grit.\n\n## Finger Screens\n\nFinger screens are long, narrow vibratory screens with segmented, tapered finger plates with spaces between the fingers through which material may pass. Material is fed into the back end of the screen and the vibrating fingers move the material along the screen. Material smaller than the openings passes through the screen while large material is retained on top and eventually passes over the end of the screen. The tapered shape of the fingers prevents material from blinding over the openings.\n\nFinger screens are often mounted in vibrating conveyors and used in waste management plants and in some hog fuel handling operations.\n\n## Thickness Screens\n\nThickness screens are specialty wood chip screens for Kraft pulp mills, where limiting the thickness of wood chips being fed to the digesters helps the penetration of pulping chemicals and digesting efficiency with consequent improvements in throughput capacity. There are (3) types of thickness screens.\n\nDisc screens used to be utilized as thickness screens, however, due to the wiping action between closely spaced discs, the discs wore quickly and soon lost their sizing accuracy. Most disc thickness screens were replaced by roll screens or bar screens in the 1990's. Sizing accuracy greatly improved and maintenance costs dropped dramatically.\n\n### Bar Thickness Screens\n\nBar thickness screens are manufactured by Jeffrey-Rader and consist of multiple banks of parallel bars mounted in a steel frame. The bars and frame are declined at approximately 3.5°. Alternate bars are interlaced and closely spaced one with the other, with the top of one bar higher than the other. Crank shafts raise and lower each set of bars, the intent being to 'tip' the wood chips on edge, so that the thinner chips can fall through the gap between the bars. Material is fed into the upper end of the machine and the oscillating bars cause the material to lift and bounce down the sloped bars. Thicker chips are retained on top of the bars and pass over the end of the screen. The bar screens do not pull the chips between the bars and therefore do not wear much; consequently, they retain their sizing accuracy for a long time.\n\nAlthough the bar screen is fairly complex with a lot of moving parts, it is quite robust. It is equipped with vibration sensors that will shut the machine down to prevent the machine from destroying itself if it were allowed to run with the various components out of balance. The bar screens have a lot of oscillating mass and the supporting structures must be designed to accommodate this.\n\n### Roll Thickness Screens\n\nRoll thickness screens manufactured by Acrowood are much less complex than the bar screens, consisting of multiple rolls mounted in a steel frame. The rolls have a grooved, diamond shaped surface and are spaced to give the appropriate clearance between the roll tips on adjacent rolls, providing a gap through which the thinner chips can pass. The thicker chips are retained on top of the rolls and pass over the end of the screen. The roll screens have a low screen open area compared to the bar screen, which results in a large screen footprint.\n\nAcrowood utilizes similar roll technology in their 'pins' and fines screens. The Acrowood roll screen is very accurate when new; however it is susceptible to unacceptable wear if there are a lot of rocks or grit in the material being fed to the screen. The roll screen handles chips gently and consequently has had problems with blinding if operating in heavy snow conditions.\n\nThe Acrowood roll screen has a low-profile and can be stacked one upon the other, resulting in a low building compared to other screen systems. Also, the roll screen doesn't impart dynamic forces into the supporting structure. But, these advantages are sometimes offset by the necessity for a larger building to accommodate the large screen footprint.\n\nAndritz makes a similar roll screen for removing fines.\n\n## Conclusions\n\n- A good screen in one application may not be appropriate for the next.\n- Just about every type of screen has already been tried on woody biomass. So, assess the material to be processed, research and investigate to find out what screen is effective, what the capital and operating costs are, and how reliable and maintenance intensive the machine is.\n- There are a lot of screen types available, and a lot of screen vendors promoting their own type and brand of machine.\n- Choose an impartial consultant engineer who has considerable woody biomass screening experience to help you select an appropriate screen for your particular needs.\n\n*Copyright © 15 November 2013*\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, servicing the forest products and energy industries.

As with other screens, Flip-Flow screens can have multiple screen decks for different size classifications.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Material is fed onto the upper end of the sloped screen and the alternating stretching and relaxing of the screen panels causes the airborne material to bounce down the screen. Particles smaller than the screen openings fall through the screen panels, while larger particles are retained on the top of the screen panels pass over the end of the screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Due to the high ‘g-forces’ imparted to the particles, Flip-flow screens are very good at processing cohesive materials that are frozen or stuck together. And, as the polyurethane panels are stretched and relaxed, the openings are also stretched and relaxed, resulting in a screen that never blinds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Flip-flow screens require much more power to drive than other machines of comparable capacity. They are very heavy duty and are costly. It is paramount that large sharp objects be kept out of the feed to the Flip-Flow screen in order to avoid damaging the polyurethane panels. Although the screen is mounted on isolation pads, the large mass and high vibration forces quite often necessitate separate support structures that go completely down to grade, so as to not impart unsuitable vibrations to the surrounding equipment or building.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Flip-Flow screens work especially well as secondary / tertiary chip screens in pulp and paper mills in extreme northern climates that have a lot of snow. The best Flip-Flow screen is the Liwell screen manufactured by Hein, Lehmann.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"trommel-screens\">Trommel Screens\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Trommel screens have cylindrical steel frameworks in which woven wire mesh screens are fastened. The screen drum lies on its side at a slight angle (2° – 8°) and has fixed steel tires that rotate on trunnion wheels. Material is fed into the upper end of the drum and as the drum rotates, the material tends to ride up the side of the drum until it falls back to the bottom. Agitated particles smaller than the screen mesh opening fall through the screen, while larger particles are carried along the bottom internal surface of the screen drum and eventually are discharged out the end of the drum. Trommel screens can be equipped with multiple sizes of screens to produce various size classifications. Depending upon the application, trommel screens can be equipped with internal ‘lifters’ or spirals to help move the material along the drum bottom.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As the amount of screen actually in contact with the material is quite low, trommel screens tend to be quite large compared to other screens of similar capacity. Long slivers tend to jam in the screen openings, resulting in the need for frequent cleaning. Trommel screens will handle a lot of abuse and are generally low cost, vibration free, and produce low noise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Trommel screens are often used on tough, dirty applications such as logyard clean-up, composting plants or municipal solid waste (MSW) plants. There are many manufacturers of trommel screens.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"grizzly-screens\">Grizzly Screens\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Grizzly screens consist of declined parallel bars. Material is fed onto the upper end of the screen and material narrower than the bar spacing falls through the bars with the larger material sliding down the bars and off the lower end of the screen. In order for the large particles to flow down the screen, static grizzly screens are quite steep, >20°. Vibrating grizzly screens can have a lower slope resulting in a longer retention time and a more efficient screen.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Grizzly screens are often used prior to and in conjunction with trommel screens to remove the gross oversized material that could jam or damage the trommel screens.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A passive form of grizzly screen utilizes screen plates with tapered, angular slots mounted in the bottom of chain conveyors. As the chain flights move material over the slots, material smaller than the slots will fall through. Such a screen is used for rough screening out small particles such as fines, sand and grit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"finger-screens\">Finger Screens\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Finger screens are long, narrow vibratory screens with segmented, tapered finger plates with spaces between the fingers through which material may pass. Material is fed into the back end of the screen and the vibrating fingers move the material along the screen. Material smaller than the openings passes through the screen while large material is retained on top and eventually passes over the end of the screen. The tapered shape of the fingers prevents material from blinding over the openings.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finger screens are often mounted in vibrating conveyors and used in waste management plants and in some hog fuel handling operations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"thickness-screens\">Thickness Screens\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Thickness screens are specialty wood chip screens for Kraft pulp mills, where limiting the thickness of wood chips being fed to the digesters helps the penetration of pulping chemicals and digesting efficiency with consequent improvements in throughput capacity. There are (3) types of thickness screens.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Disc screens used to be utilized as thickness screens, however, due to the wiping action between closely spaced discs, the discs wore quickly and soon lost their sizing accuracy. Most disc thickness screens were replaced by roll screens or bar screens in the 1990’s. Sizing accuracy greatly improved and maintenance costs dropped dramatically.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"bar-thickness-screens\">Bar Thickness Screens\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Bar thickness screens are manufactured by Jeffrey-Rader and consist of multiple banks of parallel bars mounted in a steel frame. The bars and frame are declined at approximately 3.5°. Alternate bars are interlaced and closely spaced one with the other, with the top of one bar higher than the other. Crank shafts raise and lower each set of bars, the intent being to ‘tip’ the wood chips on edge, so that the thinner chips can fall through the gap between the bars. Material is fed into the upper end of the machine and the oscillating bars cause the material to lift and bounce down the sloped bars. Thicker chips are retained on top of the bars and pass over the end of the screen. The bar screens do not pull the chips between the bars and therefore do not wear much; consequently, they retain their sizing accuracy for a long time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although the bar screen is fairly complex with a lot of moving parts, it is quite robust. It is equipped with vibration sensors that will shut the machine down to prevent the machine from destroying itself if it were allowed to run with the various components out of balance. The bar screens have a lot of oscillating mass and the supporting structures must be designed to accommodate this.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"roll-thickness-screens\">Roll Thickness Screens\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Roll thickness screens manufactured by Acrowood are much less complex than the bar screens, consisting of multiple rolls mounted in a steel frame. The rolls have a grooved, diamond shaped surface and are spaced to give the appropriate clearance between the roll tips on adjacent rolls, providing a gap through which the thinner chips can pass. The thicker chips are retained on top of the rolls and pass over the end of the screen. The roll screens have a low screen open area compared to the bar screen, which results in a large screen footprint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Acrowood utilizes similar roll technology in their ‘pins’ and fines screens. The Acrowood roll screen is very accurate when new; however it is susceptible to unacceptable wear if there are a lot of rocks or grit in the material being fed to the screen. The roll screen handles chips gently and consequently has had problems with blinding if operating in heavy snow conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Acrowood roll screen has a low-profile and can be stacked one upon the other, resulting in a low building compared to other screen systems. Also, the roll screen doesn’t impart dynamic forces into the supporting structure. But, these advantages are sometimes offset by the necessity for a larger building to accommodate the large screen footprint.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Andritz makes a similar roll screen for removing fines.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>A good screen in one application may not be appropriate for the next.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Just about every type of screen has already been tried on woody biomass.

And to ensure good quality fuel, good sampling procedures must be followed.\n\nWoody biomass in chip form has been utilized by the pulp and paper industry for many decades and chip quality has long been recognized as having an important effect on pulp quality; to make good pulp you need good chips. Likewise for a biomass-fired plant to operate efficiently, it needs a reliable, constant supply of consistent quality fuel.\n\nThis article was originally written with the pulp and paper industry in mind; however, the fundamentals of sampling wood chips also apply to the requirements of sampling biomass to be utilized as fuel.\n\nIn the past couple of decades, two opposing phenomena have emerged concerning the fibre supply for pulp and paper mills.\n\n- The supply of wood chips has shifted dramatically from high quality, whole log chips produced by a pulpmill woodroom, to residual chips from other processing industries, primarily sawmills. Residual chips can present considerable problems to the pulp mills.\n\n- The pulp mills have long known that wood chips of a certain size and configuration produce a better wood pulp and have been demanding a better quality product from their fibre suppliers.\n\nConsequently, quality control of chip supply has become more important and more difficult as most mills have multiple sources for their fibre.\n\nGood quality control relies on proper sampling, which must be accurate and precise and must truly represent the main body of chips. Without good sampling, quality control is based on false information. Bulk materials are difficult to sample properly on a production basis. Manual sampling can be done but it is labor intensive, prone to errors and does not easily fit into a production environment.\n\nCollecting samples of wood chips is one task in the mill that is not always done well. Unless the sample is taken properly, it will not be a true representation of the main product flow.\n\n### Literature on Sampling\n\nA review of the literature regarding wood chip sampling reveals that there is not a lot of good information available regarding the requirements for the actual collecting of chip samples on a production basis. Most of the literature deals with the laboratory preparation of the chip sample.\n\nThe Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) standard T 257 cm-02 titled \"Sampling and Preparing Wood for Analysis\" provides instructions for the laboratory production of wood samples and does not consider the collection of samples on a production basis.\n\nThe Scandinavian Pulp, Paper and Board Testing Committee standard SCAN-CM 41:89, \"Wood Chips for Pulp Production\", provides a basic description of the requirements for chip sampling, but focuses on the manual collection of chips.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3129:1975 \"Wood Sampling Methods and General Requirements for Physical and Mechanical Tests\" does not consider sampling wood in chip form.\n\nThe aggregate and coal industries have developed excellent standards for the collection of samples of bulk materials on a production basis. The best description of sampling requirements is provided by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D2234-02, \"Standard Practice for Collection of a Gross Sample of Coal\". While the ASTM standard is written for coal sampling, it provides an excellent description of the fundamentals of sampling a bulk product in general. Much of the procedure is applicable to wood chip sampling.\n\nThis article relies heavily on the ASTM standard D2234-02 for general sample collecting procedures and on SCAN-CM 41:89 for specific wood sampling requirements.\n\nThe intent of this article is to summarize the requirements that must be met in order to provide representative chip sampling and to do so in an easily understood and achievable manner. This article does not consider chip classification or analysis.\n\n## 1. Terminology\n\n**Lot or Consignment** – a quantity of material being sampled; can be a continuous flow or delivered in discrete quantities by truck, railcar or barge.\n\n**Increment Sample or Spot Sample** – one sample taken manually or by a sampling device.\n\n**Gross Sample** – a sample representing one lot of material and made up of a number of 'increment' samples.\n\n**Representative Sample** – The gross sample must present a true representation of the main body of biomass within certain statistical limits. To do so, requires a repeatable sampling process that has specific requirements regarding the sampling conditions.\n\n**Fractionation** – separating bulk material according to its constituent sizes, whether naturally or inadvertently.\n\n## 2. Representative Samples\n\nA single spot sample generally is less likely to be representative of the main body of biomass than is a gross sample, which is a mixture of multiple spot samples.\n\n## 3. Classification of Sampling Techniques\n\nThe quality of the sample depends upon:\n\n- The type of selection (involving discretion)\n- The conditions under which the samples are collected\n- The method of spacing of the samples (location and/or time)\n\nThese designations can be applied to any sampling technique and help to distinguish those which provide the most representative sample.\n\n### 3.1. Type of Selection\n\n**Type I** – no human discretion is used.\n\n**Type II** – human discretion is used.\n\nType I generally provides a more accurate sample.\n\n### 3.2. Conditions of Sample Collection\n\n**Condition A, Stopped Belt Cut (Reference Method)** – taking a full cross-section cut of biomass from off of a stopped conveyor belt.\n\n**Condition B, Full Stream Cut** – taking a full cross-section cut of material from a falling stream of biomass.\n\n**Condition C, Partial Stream Cut** – only taking a part of the cross-section of falling stream of biomass.\n\n**Condition D, Stationary Sampling** – taking a sample from a stationary pile or container of biomass.\n\nGenerally, the stopped belt cut provides the best sample and the stationary sampling the poorest sample.\n\n### 3.3. Sample Spacing\n\n**Spacing 1, Systematic** – samples are taken evenly spaced in time or location from the lot of biomass.\n\n**Spacing 2, Random** – samples are taken randomly spaced in time or location from the lot of biomass.\n\nSystematic Spacing generally provides better results.\n\n## 4. Features of Good Sampling\n\n**Accuracy** – the ability to obtain sample increments which represent the true nature of the biomass supply.\n\n**Precision** – a statistical term relating to the number of sample increments (spot samples) taken from a lot or consignment.\n\nBiomass is a highly variable product and requires a large number of samples in order to establish sampling precision.\n\nPrecision cannot be increased by increasing the size of the spot / increment sample.\n\nPrecision can only be increased by increasing the number of spot / increment samples.\n\n## 5. Sampling Bias\n\nSize, shape and moisture content can vary dramatically throughout one lot or consignment.\n\nPoor sampling can induce systematic errors that skew the results. Two common errors are:\n\n- Spot samples are taken where certain properties are over-represented. eg. – at tail-gate of a chip truck where fines have settled to the bottom.\n- The sample device is not capable of taking a representative sample. ie. – the sample device is too small and either rejects large pieces or overflows.\n\nProperly designed, operated and maintained automatic samplers can minimize systematic sampling bias.\n\n### 5.1. Fractionation\n\nFractionation or particle separation can occur from the way in which biomass is loaded / stacked and the way in which it is transported. eg. – fines will settle down to the bottom of a chip truck over a long haul.\n\nAdditionally, fractionation can be produced by the sampling device itself; either by rejecting oversize pieces, failing to pick-up small particles, selectively picking up small particles, or breaking up particles by the sampling motion itself.\n\nStationary material is not uniform due to fractionation where material stratifies according to size. In order to get a representative gross sample from stationary material, a large number of increment or spot samples are required.\n\n## 6. Establishing Sampling Procedures / Selecting Equipment\n\nEstablishing sampling procedures and selecting sampling devices require an understanding of:\n\n1. The nature and variability of the material being sampled.\n2. The number and size of sample increments required.\n3. The best, practical sample collection method to be used.\n4. The distribution of the sample through the whole lot.\n5. The dimensions of the sampling device.\n6. The characteristics and movement of the sampling device\n7. Impediments to collection\n8. Preservation of moisture content\n9. Contamination\n10. Mechanical features of the sampling device\n11. Personnel\n12. Location of Equipment\n13. Criteria of Performance\n14. Sample Handling and Storage\n15. A process for reducing the gross sample size to the required laboratory size\n\n### 6.1. Material Being Sampled\n\nBiomass is highly variable in size, configuration and moisture content. It is relatively fragile and size is an extremely important factor, so care must be taken not to break the biomass unnecessarily during sampling.\n\n### 6.2. Number and Size of Samples\n\nThis depends upon the variability of the biomass and is usually determined by the plant technical department based on historical statistical results.\n\nWhere new sources are coming on line, it can be expected that the number of samples required will be greater than for established sources, where historical data is available.\n\nNormal sample size required in the lab is 8-10 litres (~0.35 ft³).\n\n### 6.3. Sample Collection Method\n\nThe best practical method should be used. The 'stopped-belt, full-cut' method is the best, but is not practical.\n\nThe 'falling stream, full-cut' or 'partial cut' are the next best methods.\n\n### 6.4. Sample Distribution Through Lot\n\nSample increments must be distributed through the whole volume of the lot, so that any one particle has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThis is particularly important where 'fractionation' has occurred due to fines segregation to one part of the lot / consignment.\n\n### 6.5. Sampling Device Dimensions\n\nThe opening must be large enough so as not to reject the largest possible piece.\n\nThe capacity must be large enough to completely contain the sample without spillage.\n\n### 6.6. Characteristics and Movement of Sampling Device\n\nThere should be no rejection by size of material or movement of the device through the material.\n\nThere should be no contamination of the sample by the device.\n\nThe sample device should not damage or break up the biomass in the sample.\n\nPreferably, the sample device will pass through the entire cross-section of the stream so that each particle has an equal chance of being selected; or at least through a partial section that will contain all particle sizes within the stream.\n\nDevice speed through the flow is critical as the device must not block the flow of material. Eg. – a 48\" belt conveyor at 500 fpm delivers 16.3 ft³/sec of material. To extract 1ft³ of biomass, means the device must pass through the stream in less than a tenth of a second.\n\n### 6.7. Structural Impediments\n\nThere shall be no structural impediments that block either the collection of the sample or the flow of the material.\n\n### 6.8. Preservation of Moisture Content\n\nThe sampling device / method shall neither dry the biomass out or add moisture.\n\n### 6.9. Contamination\n\nThe device shall not contaminate the sample with foreign material or with unrelated biomass that will bias the results.\n\n### 6.10. Mechanical Features\n\nThe sampling device shall be non-clogging, self-cleaning and shall be designed to facilitate inspection and maintenance.\n\nIdeally, it will not be complex or costly to purchase and maintain.\n\n### 6.11. Personnel\n\nSampling personnel shall be properly trained and qualified; particularly where manual chip samples are collected.\n\n### 6.12. Location of Sampling Equipment\n\nEquipment shall be located where:\n\n- It can effectively take a representative sample.\n- It is convenient and readily accessible for sample taking.\n- It is readily accessible for maintenance and inspection.\n\n### 6.13. Criteria of Sampling Performance\n\nSampling procedures and equipment must be routinely monitored to ensure that the samples being collected are:\n\n- Unbiased\n- Accurate\n- Provide the degree of precision required\n- Representative of the whole lot\n\nIn addition, a constant sampling ratio should be maintained; ie. – constant volume or weight of sample as compared to the whole lot.\n\n### 6.14. Sample Handling\n\nChip samples once collected must be:\n\n- Clearly labeled and identified\n- Sealed in moisture-proof containers\n- Stored in a cool, dry place\n\nSamples properly stored in this manner can be kept in storage for up to 36 hours with no appreciable moisture loss.\n\n### 6.15. Gross Sample Size Reduction\n\nNormal increment sample size as collected will be 8-10 litres (average bucket size); therefore, combined multiple increments (the gross sample) must be reduced down to the laboratory sample size in a manner that retains biomass representative of the whole lot.\n\nLarge gross samples shall be thoroughly mixed before being reduced to laboratory sample size.\n\nAlternatively, large sample increments can themselves be sampled or split before being combined into the gross sample.\n\nLarge samples can be reduced in size by mixing thoroughly and coning and quartering or by the use of an automatic splitter.\n\n## 7. Maintenance of Sampling Equipment\n\nSampling equipment must be safely and readily accessible to enable inspection, cleaning and maintenance.\n\nWorn mechanical sampling equipment can produce biased results, therefore it is imperative that equipment is inspected, repaired when necessary, and the performance measured regularly.\n\n## 8. Design of Sampling Equipment\n\nThere are many 'off-the-shelf' product samplers; most of which were designed for materials other than biomass. However, it is the author's experience that the best sampling equipment is custom designed to meet the specific requirements of the chip sampling application considering the sampling requirements described in this paper, the product being handled, and the physical and operational constraints.\n\n## Summary\n\nTo be of value, biomass samples need to be unbiased, accurate, precise and representative of the main lot or consignment of biomass.\n\nBiomass is highly variable in size, configuration and moisture content and is prone to fractionation and stratification, which complicate the sampling procedure.\n\nSingle spot / increment samples of biomass tend not to be accurate or representative of the main lot / consignment, particularly those samples taken from stationary loads or piles where fractionation has occurred.\n\n### Common Sampling Errors\n\nTwo common sampling errors, which bias results are:\n\n- Spot samples are taken where certain properties are over-represented. eg. – at the tail-gate of a chip truck where fines have settled to the bottom.\n- The sample device is not capable of taking a representative sample. ie. – the sample device is too small and either rejects large pieces or overflows.\n\n### Best Practical Sampling Procedures\n\nThe best, practical chip sampling procedures and equipment have the following features:\n\n- Human discretion is minimized.\n- Full-stream cut or partial-stream cut sampling is employed.\n- Samples are taken systematically in time and /or location throughout the whole volume of the main lot / consignment.\n- They do not introduce bias or contaminants into the sample.\n- They are convenient to use.\n- Preferably, they automatically reduce the gross sample to the laboratory sample size.\n- Preferably, they have low capital and maintenance costs.\n\nIt is not easy to achieve all of these objectives, however, the primary goals of accuracy, precision and representativeness must take precedence.\n\nConvenience and cost, while important, are secondary considerations.\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

Or, your friend has spotted a market opportunity. All you have to do is build a plant and start producing. \"Build it and they will come.\" Sounds simple. How can you miss?\n\nEasily, I must say. The days are long gone when developing a project was as simple as pitching an idea to a bank, getting some cash, building a plant and selling your product.\n\nWith the current emphasis on producing 'green energy' from biomass and the subsequent government grants and subsidies available to promote the idea, a lot of well-meaning but inexperienced entrepreneurs are promoting the construction of plants that will process biomass into one form or another.\n\nThere are some basic steps that all projects go through, from concept to start-up, whether the 'builder' is new to the process or whether it is a company with a well formulated plan for development. Following is a brief description of the project development process.\n\n## Project Phases\n\nThe actual identified project development steps may vary in number depending upon the developer; some can be combined but most projects usually include the following phases in one form or another:\n\n**Phase 1 – Pre-feasibility:** a market opportunity is identified and rough costs and possible profits established\n\n**Phase 2 – Feasibility:** the market opportunity is analyzed; concept process alternatives developed for meeting the opportunity; challenges identified; order of magnitude capital cost estimates (CCE) developed; and one or two process alternatives selected for further development.\n\n**Phase 3 – Definition:** discussions are initiated with potential suppliers, customers, financiers, regulating bodies, environmental groups and other stakeholders; a plant location selected; plant layouts developed in sketch form; a Class 25 CCE developed for the selected alternatives; a final alternative selected for development; and a plan for project execution is established.\n\n**Phase 4 – Budget Development:** on-going discussions with potential suppliers, customers, financiers, regulating bodies, and other stakeholders, the intent being to establish memorandums of understanding (MOU's) with each party; sufficient engineering done to support the development of a Class 10 Budget CCE; preliminary discussions with potential contractors.\n\n**Phase 5 – Detail Design:** MOU's in place with suppliers and customers; financing is in place; permitting well under way; detail engineering completed for all disciplines; procurement and contracting processes started; major purchases made; Class 5 Accounting CCE established.\n\n**Phase 6 – Procurement and Contracting:** supplier and customer contracts finalized; project contracts established; purchasing completed; necessary permits in place.\n\n**Phase 7 – Construction, Commissioning and Start-up**\n\nIf the first six phases are completed successfully, then phase 7, construction, commissioning and start-up should also be successful.\n\n## Market and Financial and Economic Analysis\n\nIt goes without saying that if you don't have a secure market for your product, it doesn't matter how well engineered or constructed your project is, it won't be successful. The same applies to financing and economics. No matter the success of the technology, if the project doesn't have a satisfactory return on investment, it will not be successful. Securing markets and monitoring the financial viability are paramount. Securing a market will most likely be a condition for securing financing.\n\nThe one caveat to the above statements are projects that are supported by governments who deem that the project is socially desirable and are willing to subsidize the construction and operation of the plant, and in some cases the entire industry.\n\n## Risk\n\nRisk is associated with every venture, and must be accounted for at each stage of the project development process. Companies with well established project development processes have a formalized 'gate' procedure that assesses risk continually through the project. At the end of each of the phases described above, risk is assessed per criteria that the company has established for determining if a project is still viable. If the criteria is met, the project passes through the 'gate' and on to the next phase of the project. If the criteria is not met, then the project is either terminated or revised until all criteria are met.\n\nThis formalized gate process limits the amount of risk to the development funds that have been expended to date. There is little or no financial risk with phases 1 and 2; increasing risk with phases 3, 4 and 5; and considerable risk with phases 6 and 7, where the greatest amount of funds are expended. Hence, the criteria to pass the gate beyond phase 5 should be quite strict. However, if phases 1 through 5 have been conducted properly, and the risks have been identified and can be accommodated, then risk is minimized.\n\nCutting the project development process short and trying to make the leap from feasibility phase 2 to phase 6 or 7 increases the risk substantially.\n\n## Financing\n\nThe 'person' controlling the funds has control of the project. If you are fortunate to have enough funds that you can finance the entire project yourself, you can develop it and run it anyway you want. However, most developers work with someone else's money. This could be a single investor, a group of investors, or a bank or other lending institution.\n\nWorking with investor's money means that you will be subject to some form of accountability, which will require developing the project to a recognized development process. You will likely need a 'bankable' study which will define not only the project and business plan, but will identify the risks. Likely the lender will require that the study be prepared by a reputable third party who is knowledgeable in both the plant process and the project development process. Most often the third party is an engineering company or a construction company.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe amount of engineering undertaken depends upon the stage you are at in the development process. You don't want to do any more engineering than is required to satisfy the requirements of the current development phase. For example, you would not do detail design until you knew the project was technically and financially viable and you had MOU's in place with most of the stakeholders.\n\nThe cost of engineering can vary significantly depending upon the type of project or study. As a 'rule of thumb', expect that the total cost for the detail design of a conventional project will be in the range of 10-15% of the total direct costs.\n\nSometimes in an effort to defray the up-front costs, an entrepreneur will attempt to push the engineering onto the equipment vendors or contractors, who then hide the engineering in their overall pricing. However, it is the author's experience that vendors are not best suited to determine the most applicable process technology; there is an unavoidable bias in favour of supplying their own equipment and systems.\n\nNor are vendors the best ones to establish construction costs. They don't have the in-house expertise or the specific knowledge of the area where the project is to be constructed and often provide grossly inaccurate construction allowances.\n\nThe engineering must be done by someone; but the vendor's interests are not the same as the Owner's. As is to be expected, the vendor wants to minimize his costs and maximize his profits, and to do so, will often sacrifice technological requirements in order to reduce his costs such as simple things like making chutes too shallow or conveyors too steep.\n\nThe Owner wants to get good value; the most appropriate equipment for the lowest cost. Utilizing an Owner's engineer ensures that the owner's interests are first and foremost at all times.\n\n## Capital Cost Estimating\n\nYou will have to establish suitable capital cost estimates for each phase of the project. The amount of effort required for each phase varies; but you need to do enough work to believe in the accuracy of the estimate. A capital cost estimate for the total installed project cost includes direct costs, indirect costs and contingency; and may, or may not provide for escalation.\n\n### Direct Costs\n\nDirect costs are 'hard' project costs which usually include work done in the following disciplines:\n\n- Civil and Structural Work, including site preparation, roads, underground services, foundations, buildings, etc.\n- Mechanical and Piping Work, including process equipment and systems\n- Electrical and Instrumentation Work, including electrical power and control systems\n- Other disciplines depending upon the type of project\n\nDirect costs include the following for each discipline:\n\n- Direct purchase price of goods or service, including equipment purchases\n- Installation contractor purchases, including concrete, steel, tool rentals, sub-contractors\n- Contractor installation labour\n\n### Indirect Costs\n\nIndirect costs are 'soft' project costs that are not included in direct costs and could include allowances for such things as:\n\n- Engineering\n- Owner's development costs\n- Construction management\n- Construction living out allowance and travel, if the project is in a remote location\n- Temporary construction facilities\n- Construction insurance\n- Vendor equipment erection supervision\n- Commissioning and start-up assistance and training\n- Premium labour costs (overtime)\n- Spare parts\n- Taxes and Duties\n\nThe amount included for indirect costs depends upon company policies and the items included and can vary substantially. An average number to use is 25% of the total direct costs.\n\n### Contingency\n\nA contingency allowance should be provided in the CCE to cover those costs that are unforeseen at the time the estimate is produced and may become apparent as detailed design and construction proceed. The contingency is not intended to provide for costs associated with scope changes.\n\nThe amount of contingency to allow depends upon company policy, which should consider the amount of engineering and procurement work undertaken to produce the CCE and can vary between 5% and 25% of total direct and indirect costs. The greater the project has been defined, the lower the contingency required.\n\n## Accuracy of Capital Cost Estimate\n\nThe accuracy of a capital cost estimate depends upon the amount of engineering and procurement effort undertaken to establish the costs.\n\n**Phase 1 – Pre-feasibility Study**\n- Class 50-75 CCE\n- No engineering done\n- No procurement activities done\n- 'best intelligent guess at costs'\n\n**Phase 2 – Feasibility Study**\n- Class 40-50 CCE\n- ~ 1% of engineering completed\n- Historical data used for CCE and maybe a few verbal price quotations\n\n**Phase 3 – Definition Study**\n- Class 25 CCE\n- 5-10% of engineering completed\n- Technical specifications developed and +/-25% budget price quotations received\n- Preliminary discussions with contractors regarding unit pricing\n\n**Phase 4 – Budget Development**\n- Class 10 CCE\n- 25-35% of engineering completed\n- +/-10% budget prices obtained\n\n**Phase 5 – Detail Design**\n- 90-100% of engineering is completed\n\n**Phase 6 – Procurement and Contracting**\n- Firm equipment and contract pricing is obtained\n- Class 5 CCE accounting budget is set\n\n### Cost Estimate Definitions\n\nOne definition for the different classes of cost estimates is as follows. eg. – a Class 25 CCE is one in which there is a >90% probability that the estimated capital cost will not exceed 125% of the estimated value.\n\nA more common definition is: a Class 25 CCE is one in which the costs are within +/-25% of the estimated value. The author believes that this definition is not as reliable. It is his experience that projects are rarely less than the estimated value; and if they are, it is likely that the cost was over-estimated in the first place.\n\n## Project Execution\n\nThere are many types of project arrangements; however, following are simple descriptions of the (3) most common.\n\n### Conventional Projects\n\n- The client selects an Owner's engineer who performs a minimum of project phases 1-3 and as high as phase 6.\n- Engineering can be on a 'cost plus mark-up' or firm price basis. The cost plus basis usually provides the best value.\n- Often, the client is very familiar with the technical process.\n- If he wishes, the client can exercise considerable control all the way through the project.\n- Usually the equipment purchases and contracts are made by or in the client's name.\n- The client obtains financing for the project and assumes all risk.\n- This type of project usually results in the lowest total capital cost.\n\n### EPCM Projects\n\n- In addition to engineering and procurement functions, the Owner's engineer takes on the added responsibility of construction management and may or may not assume some of the project risk.\n\n### EPC Projects\n\n- Sometimes called 'turn-key' or 'design-build' projects.\n- The client selects a knowledgeable Owner's engineer, who looks after the client's best interests throughout the project. He will usually perform project phases 1-3 or 4, providing conceptual design and a Class 10-25 CCE and then will develop a performance-based EPC tender document, which is issued to selected companies.\n- The selected companies provide firm-price bids for (1) functioning plant.\n- The client establishes a single contract with one entity to provide the plant.\n- The Owner's engineer monitors the progress of the selected EPC contractor's work.\n- The Contractor obtains financing and assumes all risk, until the plant is complete, performance requirements have been met and the plant has been turned over to the client.","src/content/posts/so-you-want-to-build-a-biomass-plant.md","8ced8d458eddce0b",{"html":1301,"metadata":1302},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>A Beginner’s Guide to the Project Development Process\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>An edited version of this article appeared in the November / December 2011 issue of Bioenergy Insight magazine, under the title “Building a Biomass Plant”.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You have a good idea for a new way to manufacture a product.

Most of the load transfer from drive sprocket to chain occurs between the first tooth contacting the first link in the incoming chain; so, this tooth is operating under the highest pressure.\n\nThere is considerable rotation between adjacent chain links as they pass over a drive sprocket; e.g. 40° rotation on a 9T sprocket, or 30° rotation on a 12T sprocket. As the links rotate with respect to each other, there is friction between the sliding surfaces, which contributes to wear.\n\nIf the chain strand is run with the narrow end of the chain links forward, the outside of the link barrel rotates against the tooth face as the sprocket rotates and the link is seated on the sprocket.  Subsequent wear takes place between the outside of the link barrel and the tooth face; an area that is often contaminated with grit.  With chains that are under high tension, this will result in fast, high wear of the sprocket teeth.\n\nWhen running with the wide-end of the chain links in the forward direction, the link carrying the driven barrel has already rotated into position before the link contacts the tooth, and the subsequent link rotation takes place between the link pin and the inside of the link barrel.  So, as the chain link meets the sprocket, the link barrel sits neatly against the tooth face without rotating. Wear is distributed between the pin, the inside of the barrel and the tooth face.  The inside of the barrel is permanently lubricated, so wear is reduced. Consequently, it is best to minimize the wear conditions at the drive sprocket by running H-style chain with the wide-end forward.\n\nI’Anson Industries, who once manufactured conveyor chain, have, in their chain catalogue, a good graphic and explanation for running H-style chains wide-end forward.  See the graphic attached to the end of this article. \n\nThis phenomenon applies to all H-style chain, but is particularly relevant to wide, box-link drag chain, sizes H-102 through H-480, which are often used for transporting waste materials that are contaminated with sand and grit.\n\nSprocket teeth have the potential to see considerably more wear than do the chain barrels, as the chain has many more surfaces over which the wear is distributed. e.g. – a 9-tooth sprocket with a 90-link chain strand has 90/9 = 10 times the opportunity for wear than does any single link barrel.\n\nThe advantages of running wide-end forward are even greater in longer conveyors.  Pin wear is less with longer conveyors, as the pins rotate fewer times than do pins in shorter conveyors, for every strand cycle. e.g. – consider two conveyors running 8” pitch chain at the same speed, say 100 fpm; one with 90 links and one with 180 links. Each pin in the 90-link chain will have to rotate over the sprocket 100 x 12/8/90 = 1.67 times per minute as it passes over the drive sprocket under maximum load.  But each pin in a 180-link chain will rotate only 100 x 12/8/180 = 0.83 times per minute.  Less rotation = less wear.\n\nSo, in order to increase sprocket and chain life, H-style conveyor chains should run with the wide-end forward as per the following graphic.\n\n[![](/images/H-Style-Chain-Run-Direction-Graphic-r1-1024x529.jpg)](/images/H-Style-Chain-Run-Direction-Graphic-r1.jpg)\n\nGraphic 2 – H-style Drag Chains /w Wings Running Wide-End Forward\n\nRunning the chains wide-end forward was first identified in the early 1980’s by engineers working for one of the big pulp and paper engineering companies, as a way to reduce sprocket wear.  They also discovered that chains with hardened barrels and pins had much longer life; and sprocket rings with high-alloy steel lasted longer. For the next few decades most drag-chain conveyors were constructed this way, at least in western Canada. However, in the last 20 years, there has been such a high turn-over of personnel in engineering, mills and conveyor equipment fab shops that much of the knowledge behind conveyor design subtleties has been lost. This is just one example; there are many more. \n\n**Ordering H-Style Chain**\n\nChain barrels with round leading edges tend to ride-up over the material being conveyed, particularly in freezing conditions where the material wants to stick to the conveyor trough.  Chain barrels with flat-faced leading edges are better for gripping the material and scraping it clean off of the trough wearplate. Most vendors show flat-faced barrels on H-style chain running narrow-end forward as their standard. This standard chain cannot be run with wide-end forward.\n\nSo, if you wish to run H-style chain with flat-faced barrels with the wide-end forward, you must request reversed barrels when ordering.  Most vendors do not show reversed barrel chain in their catalogues, but they do say in the fine-print that they will supply reversed barrels, if requested.\n\nIf the chain has wing attachments, they have to be reversed, too. \n\nIt’s also a good idea to specify hardened barrels and hardened pins, which have better wear characteristics.  I also recommend low-wear, high-alloy sprocket rings. \n\nAlso, the installation of stripper plates underneath the drive sprockets are recommended to ensure the chain links are stripped cleanly off of the drive sprocket.\n\nChains and sprockets constructed as I’ve described cost more to purchase, but they have much longer life and fewer break-downs, which is particularly important in industrial facilities that operate 24/7 and must run reliably all year long.\n\nSee the following photograph showing the chains running in the correct direction with the wide-end forward. This is on a conveyor with high-alloy traction wheels on the head-drum, and an \\`S’-drive sprocket underneath the conveyor.\n\n[![](/images/18-002-Hopper-Conveyor-Oct-2005-017.jpg)](/images/18-002-Hopper-Conveyor-Oct-2005-017.jpg)\n\nPhoto 1 – H-style Drag Chains Running Wide-End Forward (correct direction)\n\n**Wear Examples From Running Narrow-End Forward**\n\nAt one biomass-fired power plant, it was observed that one of the chains on a 2-strand H-480 hogfuel chain conveyor was running with the wide-end of the chain links forward and the other strand was running with the narrow-end forward, and the wear difference between the respective drive sprocket teeth was remarkable.  The drive sprocket teeth on the strand running narrow-end forward were badly worn and were hooked so bad that they had trouble releasing the chain. \n\nSee the following photographs.\n\n[![](/images/Drag-Chain-Direction-Photo-1-1024x820.jpg)](/images/Drag-Chain-Direction-Photo-1.jpg)\n\nPhoto 2 – Hogfuel Drag Chain on Left is Running Wide-End Forward (correct); Chain on Right is incorrect.\n\n[![](/images/Drag-Chain-Sprocket-Wear-1-1024x768.jpg)](/images/Drag-Chain-Sprocket-Wear-1.jpg)\n\nPhoto 3 – Worn \\`Hooked’ Sprocket Teeth from Running Narrow-End of Link Forward\n\nThe adjacent sprocket with the Wide-End Forward chain showed minimal wear.\n\nAnother extreme example of improperly selected H-style box-link drag chain was at another biomass-fired power plant, which was running H-480 chain with the narrow-end forward on a wet bottom-ash chain conveyor.  The extreme conditions wore-out the drive sprocket in less than 6 months. The worn-out, hooked teeth are clearly seen in the following photograph.\n\n[![](/images/DSC00699b-1024x665.jpg)](/images/DSC00699b-scaled.jpg)\n\nPhoto4 – Extreme Sprocket Wear in 6 Months\n\nCopywrite © December 2020\n\n**About the Author**\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years of experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing, plant trouble-shooting, optimization and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

Each pin in the 90-link chain will have to rotate over the sprocket 100 x 12/8/90 = 1.67 times per minute as it passes over the drive sprocket under maximum load.  But each pin in a 180-link chain will rotate only 100 x 12/8/180 = 0.83 times per minute.  Less rotation = less wear.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, in order to increase sprocket and chain life, H-style conveyor chains should run with the wide-end forward as per the following graphic.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/images/H-Style-Chain-Run-Direction-Graphic-r1.jpg\">\u003Cimg src=\"/images/H-Style-Chain-Run-Direction-Graphic-r1-1024x529.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Graphic 2 – H-style Drag Chains /w Wings Running Wide-End Forward\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Running the chains wide-end forward was first identified in the early 1980’s by engineers working for one of the big pulp and paper engineering companies, as a way to reduce sprocket wear.  They also discovered that chains with hardened barrels and pins had much longer life; and sprocket rings with high-alloy steel lasted longer. For the next few decades most drag-chain conveyors were constructed this way, at least in western Canada. However, in the last 20 years, there has been such a high turn-over of personnel in engineering, mills and conveyor equipment fab shops that much of the knowledge behind conveyor design subtleties has been lost.

This standard chain cannot be run with wide-end forward.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, if you wish to run H-style chain with flat-faced barrels with the wide-end forward, you must request reversed barrels when ordering.  Most vendors do not show reversed barrel chain in their catalogues, but they do say in the fine-print that they will supply reversed barrels, if requested.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If the chain has wing attachments, they have to be reversed, too. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s also a good idea to specify hardened barrels and hardened pins, which have better wear characteristics.  I also recommend low-wear, high-alloy sprocket rings. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Also, the installation of stripper plates underneath the drive sprockets are recommended to ensure the chain links are stripped cleanly off of the drive sprocket.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chains and sprockets constructed as I’ve described cost more to purchase, but they have much longer life and fewer break-downs, which is particularly important in industrial facilities that operate 24/7 and must run reliably all year long.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>See the following photograph showing the chains running in the correct direction with the wide-end forward.

Chips less than 7 mm thick pulp more completely than thicker chips, giving a uniform raw material for easily controlled pulping and bleaching. Additionally, removing the 'pins' and 'fines' from the digester feed improves operating performance.\n\nChip thickness screening (CTS) is a wood chip segregation and conditioning process that removes the overthick chips from the chip furnish and processes them either by slicing or crushing so that they can be uniformly cooked along with the screen accepts.\n\nMost mills recognized the benefits of CTS in the early 1990's and installed CTS systems; however, there were significant technological advances in the late 1990's that many mills missed and still have not upgraded their equipment to the latest, most efficient technologies.\n\nAlthough the actual pulping process improvements resulting from the application of CTS may vary from mill to mill, generally improvements can be found in the following areas:\n\n- Improved wood utilization.\n- Increased digester maximum production.\n- Increased yield.\n- Decreased digester alkali application.\n- Recovery boiler solids reduction.\n- Increased chip screens system availability.\n- Less mechanical damage due to foreign materials such as rocks.\n\nThis article provides a brief description of the CTS process and summarizes the potential benefits.\n\n## 1. Description of a Typical CTS System\n\nChip thickness screening is a purely physical mechanical process and since its initial application, has been continually improving in efficiency of operation and utilization of equipment.\n\nA typical CTS system consists of a scalping screen for gross-overs removal, primary thickness screen(s) to remove the overthick chips, secondary screen(s) to separate the accepts chips from the pins and fines and tertiary screen(s) to separate the pins from the fines. Some mills utilize a 4th (quaternary) level of screens for further refining the fines fraction. In addition, an air density separator and either a chip slicer or a chip crusher (conditioner / cracker) is utilized to further process the overthick chips.\n\nUnscreened wood chips are reclaimed from the chip storage area and are conveyed to the scalping disc screen where the 'gross oversized' pieces such as sticks, frozen lumps and large stones are removed. The acceptable material passing through the scalping screen is directed to a primary screen that segregates acceptable chips (accepts \u003C8-9 mm) by thickness from overthick chips.\n\nThe overthick fraction passes over the end of the primary screen and is conveyed to an air density separator (ADS) where rocks, knots and other 'heavies' are separated from the lighter overthick chips. The ADS discharges the heavies into a reject bunker and conveys the acceptable material to the overthick treatment equipment where the recovered overthick chips are sliced or crushed to produce an acceptable chip for cooking, before being diverted to the accepts conveyor to the pulpmill.\n\nThe 'fines-rich' fraction passing through the primary screen, is diverted to the secondary screen(s) for further pins / fines processing, and the 'clean' portion of the accepts fraction from the primary screen is directed to the accepts conveyor to the pulpmill.\n\nThe secondary screen(s) separate the remaining accepts chips from the entrapped 'pins' and 'fines' and directs the cleaned accepts to the accepts conveyor to the pulpmill. Pins and fines are diverted to the tertiary screen(s), which separate the fines from the pin chips.\n\nDirt and grit are concentrated in the fines fraction rejected from the tertiary screen, which is usually diverted to the wastewood hog fuel flow to the biomass boiler.\n\nThe percentage of pins in the digester furnish that a Kamyr digester can accept and remain operating satisfactorily, typically varies from 5 to 10%. So, depending upon the amount of pins in the chip flow and the digester's ability to handle pins, a portion of the pin chips (0 – 100%) is diverted from the tertiary screen to the accepts flow to the pulpmill, while the balance is rejected with the fines. It becomes a fine balance between rejecting too much fibre and maintaining an efficient digester operation.\n\nTypical guarantees for single and dual-line chip thickness screening systems are:\n\n- 100 units per hour per line (1.0 unit = 200 ft³ or 5.6m³)\n- 95% overthick removal efficiency (ORE)\n- 90% fines removal efficiency (FRE)\n\n## 2. Process Design Considerations\n\n### 2.1 Chip Quality and Digesting Tests\n\nInformation regarding the incoming chip supply to the screening system is of primary importance for process design. However, information regarding the current chip quality data is often very limited. In order to accurately specify and design a chip thickness screening system, it is recommended that a comprehensive chip sampling and testing program and a corresponding cooking test program be instituted to clearly define the present operating circumstances and determine the optimum chip size and pins and fines content that best suits the mill's particular pulping process.\n\nAfter the installation of a CTS system, the chip sampling program should continue to be utilized to monitor the quality of the incoming wood chips and the performance of the screening system.\n\n### 2.2 Typical Chip Supply to the Screening System\n\nThe following table summarizes a typical chip supply to the screening system.\n\n| Classification | Definition / Test Screen Size | Average | Bad Case |\n|---------------|------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Gross Over-sized Chips | > 45 mm RH | 1.8% | 5.3% |\n| Overthick Chips | \u003C45 mm RH; >8 mm slot | 9.4% | 19.5% |\n| Accept Chips | \u003C8 mm slot; >7 mm RH | 81.9% | 57.0% |\n| Pin Chips | \u003C 7 mm RH; > 3 mm RH | 4.9% | 12.2% |\n| Fines / Pan | \u003C 3 mm RH | 2% | 6% |\n\nThe definitions for the various classifications differ from mill to mill. For instance, some mills consider accepts as that material passing through a \u003C7 mm slot and pins as that material passing through a combination of >3 mm RH and \u003C2 mm slot.\n\nComprehensive chip data is necessary in order to produce a reliable result. It is recommended that prudence be exercised when selecting the final numbers as the worst scenario will vary considerably.\n\nAt the primary screen, the design should strive for the highest possible overthick removal efficiency (ORE), while limiting accepts carry over (ACO) to a minimum. The primary screen must be capable of handling all types of variations in chip geometry, as the chip sources and quality will change over time.\n\nThe secondary screen separates the accepts from the pins and fines. Fines removal efficiency (FRE) and accepts fibre loss (AFL) are the key factors at the secondary screen. AFL and fines carry over (FCO) are the key factors at the tertiary screen.\n\n### 2.3 CTS System Sizing and Capacity\n\nThe size of a CTS system should be based on the maximum sustainable peak digester production rates, as this will determine the maximum chip flow through the CTS system. Conversely, the potential savings attributable to CTS should be based on the annual average production rate.\n\nFactors to consider when sizing a CTS system include:\n\n- Steady flow through a Kamyr digester.\n- Surge flows through batch digesters.\n- Different species have different moisture contents, bulk densities, particle size distributions (PSD) and fibre yields.\n- Screening losses and efficiencies with different types of screens.\n\n### 2.4 Anticipated CTS System Performance\n\nCTS systems provide a marked improvement in chip quality over screening systems using only gyratory or vibrating screens. It is anticipated that a well designed and operated CTS system will be able to reduce overthick chips in the furnish to the digester to less than 2% and fines to approximately 0.5%.\n\nThe table below summarizes the anticipated chip quality from a modern CTS system.\n\n| Parameter | Target |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Overthick to Digester | \u003C2% |\n| Pins to Digester (see note) | \u003C7% |\n| Fines to Digester | \u003C0.5% |\n\n**Note:** In order not to reject too much fibre, the pins content in the feed to the digester should be the maximum that the digester can tolerate.\n\nWhen doing a study assessing the viability of a CTS system, it is necessary to prepare a detailed mass balance, which shows the anticipated system performance based on the average and bad case chip sampling data shown above.\n\n## 3. Benefits of a CTS System\n\nIndustry experience has identified several direct benefits attributable to the use of CTS in the Kraft pulping process. These benefits are well-documented and include the following:\n\n- A more uniform cook following a reduction in rejects by a factor ranging from 1.5 – 3.\n- An increase in yield through lower reject rates. Most Kraft mills with CTS systems experience lower rejects and higher yield. A 2% increase in yield and a 50% reduction in rejects are typical values for North American mills that convert to CTS screening.\n- A direct cost benefit from increased yield at a higher kappa number.\n- Reduced load for recovery operations because of reduced alkali usage per ton of pulp, resulting in either better chemical and energy efficiency or increased production.\n\nThese benefits are achieved primarily because of the supply of more uniformly-sized chips to the digester that translates into a more-uniform cook, cleaner pulp delivered to the bleach plant and lower chemical usage for bleaching to a given brightness.\n\nBenefits can be derived from:\n\n- Treatment of overthick chips.\n- Reduced small particle generation (SPG).\n- Removing fines from the digester furnish.\n- Recovery of pins and rejected accepts.\n- Recovery of acceptable overthick fibre.\n- Removal of rocks, grit and dirt.\n- Reduced Liquor Usage.\n\n### 3.1 Uniform Cooking of Overthick Chips\n\nOverthick chips do not fully pulp during the Kraft pulping process and are discharged as knots. When these under-cooked 'knots' are re-cooked, they produce a pulp with much lower yield and strength than pulp from properly sized chips.\n\nThe amount of knots rejected in a pulping line gives an indication of the proportion of overthick chips in the digester feed. For a mill without a CTS system, which uses predominantly sawmill residual chips, the amount of knotter rejects normally amounts to 2% to 3% of pulp production. With CTS and oversize chip treatment, knotter rejects are typically reduced to less than 0.5%.\n\nRecirculating under-cooked 'knots' in a pulping system occupies digester space. Removal of the overthick chips allows a greater quantity of accepts chips to fill the volume otherwise occupied by recirculated knots on their first or subsequent pass through the digester, and allows production to be increased in a digester-limited mill.\n\n### 3.2 Fines Removal\n\nFines occupy the interstitial spaces between larger chips, so removing all of the fines will reduce the digester throughput. Also, removing all of the fines represents a considerable fibre loss. However, excess fines can cause considerable operating difficulties in a Kamyr digester, such as level control problems in the chip chute and pluggage in the top separator or extraction screens, resulting in lost digester production. Removal of fines and reduction in the overall percentage of undersized chips in the digester feed improves the circulation rate and increases yield by reducing overcooking of undersized chips.\n\nFines absorb pulping chemicals and are removed when the chemicals are processed in the recovery boiler. An excess amount of fines places additional load on the recovery boiler and results in lost production in a recovery-limited mill.\n\nGyratory screening systems are not effective at removing fines from the digester furnish during wet or freezing weather conditions. The newer styles of secondary and tertiary screens are able to remove fines much more efficiently, allowing digester production to be maintained throughout adverse weather conditions.\n\n### 3.3 Reduced Fines Generation\n\nThe first CTS systems utilized rechippers or chip slicers. Rechippers indiscriminately chop-up over-sized wood pieces into random bits, generating large quantities of small particles. Chip slicers were an attempt to control the thickness of the re-processed overthick chips by re-slicing them to the desired thickness. However, slicers make one good chip and one thin chip out of every overthick chip and generate a lot of pins and fines.\n\nA typical rechipper or a poorly maintained chip slicer will degrade 20%-40% of the processed material into fines. Assuming that 11%-12% of the incoming chip supply is comprised of over-sized and overthick chips, the amount of degraded material coming from a rechipper or slicer is substantial. This degraded material is either added to the digester furnish, increasing the fines content or is returned to the chip screens, where it is removed and lost. This lost fibre must be replaced by the purchase of incremental chips. One mill calculated the value of fibre lost to fines to be approximately $1.5M per year.\n\nAdditionally, rechippers or chip slicers require considerable maintenance to remain in effective operating condition and if not maintained or operated properly will result in even greater amounts of small particle generation (SPG).\n\nModern CTS systems utilize chip crushers, which crush the overthick chips, creating fissures into which the digesting chemicals can penetrate, thereby permitting the chips to digest at nearly the same rate as accept chips. CTS systems that utilize chip crushers normally operate for many months without appreciable maintenance and SPG is limited to ~1.5%.\n\n### 3.4 Recovery of Pins and Rejected Accepts\n\nOld style screening systems (no CTS) often reject acceptable chip fibre with the screened-out chip fines. In the quest to remove all the chip fines, gyratory screens will often have 5/16\" – 3/8\" openings with the result that acceptable mini-chips and pin chips in the 3-7 mm thickness range are often rejected. Accepts rejection rates of 2%-3.5% are not uncommon, based on experience at coastal mills.\n\nMore than 90% of these lost accepts would be recovered by modern secondary / tertiary screens and could be reintroduced into the digester furnish in metered amounts.\n\n### 3.5 Recovery of Rejected Overthick Fibre\n\nIn an old style screening system, oversized / overthick but good fibre is rejected along with rocks to landfill. In a modern CTS system, this lost fibre would be efficiently separated and recovered at the ADS system and reprocessed in the overthick crusher.\n\n### 3.6 Removal of Rocks, Grit and Dirt\n\nCTS screening systems remove some of the rocks, sand and grit. Rocks larger than the disc interface opening (IFO) of the scalping screen will be removed with the gross-oversized chips (typically >2.5\").\n\nRocks larger than the primary screen openings (>8mm) will be diverted to the ADS system with the overthick chips and will be discharged from the ADS with other 'heavies' into a rejects bunker.\n\nSand, grit and dirt smaller than the tertiary screen openings (\u003C3mm) will be removed from the chip flow with the rejected chip fines.\n\nStones smaller than the primary screen openings and larger than the tertiary screen openings will remain in the chip flow to the digester (i.e. \u003C8mm, >3mm). These rocks could be removed by processing the accepts chip flow from the secondary and tertiary screens through a 2nd ADS system designed for the service.\n\nSimilarly, the small stones rejected with the fines from the tertiary screen could be removed from the fines rejects flow by processing the fines rejects through a 3rd ADS system designed for the service.\n\nRemoving the rocks, sand and grit from the pulpmill furnish has the benefit of reducing blow line plugging and mechanical damage to the knotters, blow tank pumps, digester feeders and pulp screens, resulting in increased digester operating time, hence higher production rates.\n\nOne mill has estimated damage to mechanical equipment from rocks in the chips, to be about $500,000 per year.\n\n### 3.7 Reduced Pulping Liquor Usage\n\nBecause the amount of overthick chips and fines are reduced where chip thickness screening is utilized, the white liquor application to the digester can be reduced, which reduces the loading in the recausticizing and kiln areas. This in turn, reduces direct operating costs per tonne of pulp produced.\n\nMill data indicates a 5% decrease in alkali for a 2% increase in yield. A reduction in alkali is expected for two reasons – less wood substance is dissolved and a lower residual is required to produce clean pulp.\n\nA reduced alkali requirement of 0.6% AA/BDt wood has been observed in the recausticizing / kiln area resulting from the installation of a modern CTS. This level of reduced alkali usage has been observed at several B.C. mills with CTS installations.\n\n## 4. Potential Savings Attributed to CTS\n\n### 4.1 Yield Improvement\n\nWith the installation of a modern CTS system, pulp yield is expected to rise by 1.5% – 2%. This has been observed in several BC mills that have installed CTS systems. This is roughly equal to a reduction in fibre usage of 0.035 BDU per ADt of pulp produced.\n\n### 4.2 Reduction in Bleaching Chemicals\n\nIn one mill, improved uniformity and reduced shive content in the pulp was conservatively estimated to reduce bleaching costs by $1 per ADt.\n\n### 4.3 Offloading the Recovery Boiler\n\nFor mills that are recovery limited, a CTS system would help to offload the recovery boiler, enabling a production increase.\n\n### 4.4 Manning Reduction\n\nModern CTS systems operate continuously with no dedicated operator in attendance, and with no rechipper or chip slicer, maintenance costs are much lower.\n\n### 4.5 Other Potential Benefits\n\nOther savings associated with CTS utilization, include the following:\n\n- Reduced steam usage.\n- Improved washing.\n- Improvements in pulp quality.\n- Defoamer reductions.\n\nSuch allowances are difficult to quantify and the net effect of such allowances is small compared to the main benefits identified above.\n\n### 4.6 Total Benefits\n\nIf all of the above mentioned benefits are realized, the replacement of an old style, non-CTS screening system with a modern CTS system can result in annual savings of $5.0M to $6.0M CAD.\n\n## 5. CTS System Upgrades\n\nUpgrading an old-style CTS system with a modern CTS system will, of course, not see the full savings, as most of the savings were realized when the original CTS system was installed.\n\n### Primary Screen Upgrades\n\nOld style CTS systems utilize disc type of thickness screens and chip slicers. Disc screens experience high wear and do not maintain their accuracy for long. Maintenance costs are high and progressively thicker chips are accepted as the discs wear, often moving outside the chip thickness 'sweet spot'. Modern 'bar' type thickness screens do not wear quickly and maintain their accuracy for long periods of time.\n\n### Overthick Processing Upgrades\n\nAs previously mentioned, chip slicers degrade the material being processed, generate high volumes of fines and require considerable weekly maintenance. Modern chip 'conditioners' or chip 'crackers' generate minimal fines and run from year-to-year without requiring continuous maintenance.\n\n### Secondary / Tertiary Screen Upgrades\n\nFlexible mat screens are very effective in separating accepts chips from pins and fines in wet and freezing climates.\n\nRoll screens are very effective in separating accepts from pins and fines, and in separating pins from fines in warm climates.\n\n## 6.

Description of a Typical CTS System\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Chip thickness screening is a purely physical mechanical process and since its initial application, has been continually improving in efficiency of operation and utilization of equipment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A typical CTS system consists of a scalping screen for gross-overs removal, primary thickness screen(s) to remove the overthick chips, secondary screen(s) to separate the accepts chips from the pins and fines and tertiary screen(s) to separate the pins from the fines. Some mills utilize a 4th (quaternary) level of screens for further refining the fines fraction. In addition, an air density separator and either a chip slicer or a chip crusher (conditioner / cracker) is utilized to further process the overthick chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unscreened wood chips are reclaimed from the chip storage area and are conveyed to the scalping disc screen where the ‘gross oversized’ pieces such as sticks, frozen lumps and large stones are removed. The acceptable material passing through the scalping screen is directed to a primary screen that segregates acceptable chips (accepts &#x3C;8-9 mm) by thickness from overthick chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The overthick fraction passes over the end of the primary screen and is conveyed to an air density separator (ADS) where rocks, knots and other ‘heavies’ are separated from the lighter overthick chips. The ADS discharges the heavies into a reject bunker and conveys the acceptable material to the overthick treatment equipment where the recovered overthick chips are sliced or crushed to produce an acceptable chip for cooking, before being diverted to the accepts conveyor to the pulpmill.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The ‘fines-rich’ fraction passing through the primary screen, is diverted to the secondary screen(s) for further pins / fines processing, and the ‘clean’ portion of the accepts fraction from the primary screen is directed to the accepts conveyor to the pulpmill.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The secondary screen(s) separate the remaining accepts chips from the entrapped ‘pins’ and ‘fines’ and directs the cleaned accepts to the accepts conveyor to the pulpmill. Pins and fines are diverted to the tertiary screen(s), which separate the fines from the pin chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dirt and grit are concentrated in the fines fraction rejected from the tertiary screen, which is usually diverted to the wastewood hog fuel flow to the biomass boiler.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The percentage of pins in the digester furnish that a Kamyr digester can accept and remain operating satisfactorily, typically varies from 5 to 10%. So, depending upon the amount of pins in the chip flow and the digester’s ability to handle pins, a portion of the pin chips (0 – 100%) is diverted from the tertiary screen to the accepts flow to the pulpmill, while the balance is rejected with the fines. It becomes a fine balance between rejecting too much fibre and maintaining an efficient digester operation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Typical guarantees for single and dual-line chip thickness screening systems are:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>100 units per hour per line (1.0 unit = 200 ft³ or 5.6m³)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>95% overthick removal efficiency (ORE)\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>90% fines removal efficiency (FRE)\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"2-process-design-considerations\">2.

However, information regarding the current chip quality data is often very limited. In order to accurately specify and design a chip thickness screening system, it is recommended that a comprehensive chip sampling and testing program and a corresponding cooking test program be instituted to clearly define the present operating circumstances and determine the optimum chip size and pins and fines content that best suits the mill’s particular pulping process.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After the installation of a CTS system, the chip sampling program should continue to be utilized to monitor the quality of the incoming wood chips and the performance of the screening system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"22-typical-chip-supply-to-the-screening-system\">2.2 Typical Chip Supply to the Screening System\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The following table summarizes a typical chip supply to the screening system.\u003C/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Ctable>\u003Cthead>\u003Ctr>\u003Cth>Classification\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Definition / Test Screen Size\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Average\u003C/th>\u003Cth>Bad Case\u003C/th>\u003C/tr>\u003C/thead>\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>Gross Over-sized Chips\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>> 45 mm RH\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>1.8%\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>5.3%\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>Overthick Chips\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>&#x3C;45 mm RH; >8 mm slot\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>9.4%\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>19.5%\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>Accept Chips\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>&#x3C;8 mm slot; >7 mm RH\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>81.9%\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>57.0%\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>Pin Chips\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>&#x3C; 7 mm RH; > 3 mm RH\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>4.9%\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>12.2%\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>Fines / Pan\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>&#x3C; 3 mm RH\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>2%\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>6%\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003C/tbody>\u003C/table>\n\u003Cp>The definitions for the various classifications differ from mill to mill.

It is recommended that prudence be exercised when selecting the final numbers as the worst scenario will vary considerably.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the primary screen, the design should strive for the highest possible overthick removal efficiency (ORE), while limiting accepts carry over (ACO) to a minimum. The primary screen must be capable of handling all types of variations in chip geometry, as the chip sources and quality will change over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The secondary screen separates the accepts from the pins and fines.

Benefits of a CTS System\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Industry experience has identified several direct benefits attributable to the use of CTS in the Kraft pulping process. These benefits are well-documented and include the following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>A more uniform cook following a reduction in rejects by a factor ranging from 1.5 – 3.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>An increase in yield through lower reject rates. Most Kraft mills with CTS systems experience lower rejects and higher yield. A 2% increase in yield and a 50% reduction in rejects are typical values for North American mills that convert to CTS screening.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A direct cost benefit from increased yield at a higher kappa number.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Reduced load for recovery operations because of reduced alkali usage per ton of pulp, resulting in either better chemical and energy efficiency or increased production.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>These benefits are achieved primarily because of the supply of more uniformly-sized chips to the digester that translates into a more-uniform cook, cleaner pulp delivered to the bleach plant and lower chemical usage for bleaching to a given brightness.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Benefits can be derived from:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Treatment of overthick chips.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Reduced small particle generation (SPG).\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Removing fines from the digester furnish.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Recovery of pins and rejected accepts.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Recovery of acceptable overthick fibre.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Removal of rocks, grit and dirt.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Reduced Liquor Usage.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"31-uniform-cooking-of-overthick-chips\">3.1 Uniform Cooking of Overthick Chips\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Overthick chips do not fully pulp during the Kraft pulping process and are discharged as knots. When these under-cooked ‘knots’ are re-cooked, they produce a pulp with much lower yield and strength than pulp from properly sized chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The amount of knots rejected in a pulping line gives an indication of the proportion of overthick chips in the digester feed. For a mill without a CTS system, which uses predominantly sawmill residual chips, the amount of knotter rejects normally amounts to 2% to 3% of pulp production. With CTS and oversize chip treatment, knotter rejects are typically reduced to less than 0.5%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Recirculating under-cooked ‘knots’ in a pulping system occupies digester space. Removal of the overthick chips allows a greater quantity of accepts chips to fill the volume otherwise occupied by recirculated knots on their first or subsequent pass through the digester, and allows production to be increased in a digester-limited mill.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"32-fines-removal\">3.2 Fines Removal\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Fines occupy the interstitial spaces between larger chips, so removing all of the fines will reduce the digester throughput. Also, removing all of the fines represents a considerable fibre loss. However, excess fines can cause considerable operating difficulties in a Kamyr digester, such as level control problems in the chip chute and pluggage in the top separator or extraction screens, resulting in lost digester production. Removal of fines and reduction in the overall percentage of undersized chips in the digester feed improves the circulation rate and increases yield by reducing overcooking of undersized chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Fines absorb pulping chemicals and are removed when the chemicals are processed in the recovery boiler. An excess amount of fines places additional load on the recovery boiler and results in lost production in a recovery-limited mill.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Gyratory screening systems are not effective at removing fines from the digester furnish during wet or freezing weather conditions. The newer styles of secondary and tertiary screens are able to remove fines much more efficiently, allowing digester production to be maintained throughout adverse weather conditions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"33-reduced-fines-generation\">3.3 Reduced Fines Generation\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The first CTS systems utilized rechippers or chip slicers. Rechippers indiscriminately chop-up over-sized wood pieces into random bits, generating large quantities of small particles. Chip slicers were an attempt to control the thickness of the re-processed overthick chips by re-slicing them to the desired thickness. However, slicers make one good chip and one thin chip out of every overthick chip and generate a lot of pins and fines.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A typical rechipper or a poorly maintained chip slicer will degrade 20%-40% of the processed material into fines. Assuming that 11%-12% of the incoming chip supply is comprised of over-sized and overthick chips, the amount of degraded material coming from a rechipper or slicer is substantial. This degraded material is either added to the digester furnish, increasing the fines content or is returned to the chip screens, where it is removed and lost. This lost fibre must be replaced by the purchase of incremental chips. One mill calculated the value of fibre lost to fines to be approximately $1.5M per year.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Additionally, rechippers or chip slicers require considerable maintenance to remain in effective operating condition and if not maintained or operated properly will result in even greater amounts of small particle generation (SPG).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Modern CTS systems utilize chip crushers, which crush the overthick chips, creating fissures into which the digesting chemicals can penetrate, thereby permitting the chips to digest at nearly the same rate as accept chips. CTS systems that utilize chip crushers normally operate for many months without appreciable maintenance and SPG is limited to ~1.5%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"34-recovery-of-pins-and-rejected-accepts\">3.4 Recovery of Pins and Rejected Accepts\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Old style screening systems (no CTS) often reject acceptable chip fibre with the screened-out chip fines. In the quest to remove all the chip fines, gyratory screens will often have 5/16” – 3/8” openings with the result that acceptable mini-chips and pin chips in the 3-7 mm thickness range are often rejected. Accepts rejection rates of 2%-3.5% are not uncommon, based on experience at coastal mills.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More than 90% of these lost accepts would be recovered by modern secondary / tertiary screens and could be reintroduced into the digester furnish in metered amounts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"35-recovery-of-rejected-overthick-fibre\">3.5 Recovery of Rejected Overthick Fibre\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In an old style screening system, oversized / overthick but good fibre is rejected along with rocks to landfill. In a modern CTS system, this lost fibre would be efficiently separated and recovered at the ADS system and reprocessed in the overthick crusher.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"36-removal-of-rocks-grit-and-dirt\">3.6 Removal of Rocks, Grit and Dirt\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>CTS screening systems remove some of the rocks, sand and grit. Rocks larger than the disc interface opening (IFO) of the scalping screen will be removed with the gross-oversized chips (typically >2.5”).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rocks larger than the primary screen openings (>8mm) will be diverted to the ADS system with the overthick chips and will be discharged from the ADS with other ‘heavies’ into a rejects bunker.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sand, grit and dirt smaller than the tertiary screen openings (&#x3C;3mm) will be removed from the chip flow with the rejected chip fines.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stones smaller than the primary screen openings and larger than the tertiary screen openings will remain in the chip flow to the digester (i.e. &#x3C;8mm, >3mm). These rocks could be removed by processing the accepts chip flow from the secondary and tertiary screens through a 2nd ADS system designed for the service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Similarly, the small stones rejected with the fines from the tertiary screen could be removed from the fines rejects flow by processing the fines rejects through a 3rd ADS system designed for the service.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Removing the rocks, sand and grit from the pulpmill furnish has the benefit of reducing blow line plugging and mechanical damage to the knotters, blow tank pumps, digester feeders and pulp screens, resulting in increased digester operating time, hence higher production rates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One mill has estimated damage to mechanical equipment from rocks in the chips, to be about $500,000 per year.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"37-reduced-pulping-liquor-usage\">3.7 Reduced Pulping Liquor Usage\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Because the amount of overthick chips and fines are reduced where chip thickness screening is utilized, the white liquor application to the digester can be reduced, which reduces the loading in the recausticizing and kiln areas. This in turn, reduces direct operating costs per tonne of pulp produced.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mill data indicates a 5% decrease in alkali for a 2% increase in yield. A reduction in alkali is expected for two reasons – less wood substance is dissolved and a lower residual is required to produce clean pulp.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A reduced alkali requirement of 0.6% AA/BDt wood has been observed in the recausticizing / kiln area resulting from the installation of a modern CTS. This level of reduced alkali usage has been observed at several B.C. mills with CTS installations.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"4-potential-savings-attributed-to-cts\">4. Potential Savings Attributed to CTS\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"41-yield-improvement\">4.1 Yield Improvement\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>With the installation of a modern CTS system, pulp yield is expected to rise by 1.5% – 2%. This has been observed in several BC mills that have installed CTS systems. This is roughly equal to a reduction in fibre usage of 0.035 BDU per ADt of pulp produced.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"42-reduction-in-bleaching-chemicals\">4.2 Reduction in Bleaching Chemicals\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In one mill, improved uniformity and reduced shive content in the pulp was conservatively estimated to reduce bleaching costs by $1 per ADt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"43-offloading-the-recovery-boiler\">4.3 Offloading the Recovery Boiler\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>For mills that are recovery limited, a CTS system would help to offload the recovery boiler, enabling a production increase.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"44-manning-reduction\">4.4 Manning Reduction\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Modern CTS systems operate continuously with no dedicated operator in attendance, and with no rechipper or chip slicer, maintenance costs are much lower.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"45-other-potential-benefits\">4.5 Other Potential Benefits\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Other savings associated with CTS utilization, include the following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Reduced steam usage.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Improved washing.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Improvements in pulp quality.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Defoamer reductions.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Such allowances are difficult to quantify and the net effect of such allowances is small compared to the main benefits identified above.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"46-total-benefits\">4.6 Total Benefits\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>If all of the above mentioned benefits are realized, the replacement of an old style, non-CTS screening system with a modern CTS system can result in annual savings of $5.0M to $6.0M CAD.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"5-cts-system-upgrades\">5. CTS System Upgrades\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Upgrading an old-style CTS system with a modern CTS system will, of course, not see the full savings, as most of the savings were realized when the original CTS system was installed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"primary-screen-upgrades\">Primary Screen Upgrades\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Old style CTS systems utilize disc type of thickness screens and chip slicers. Disc screens experience high wear and do not maintain their accuracy for long. Maintenance costs are high and progressively thicker chips are accepted as the discs wear, often moving outside the chip thickness ‘sweet spot’.

However, woody biomass is light and bulky and when transporting large volumes over long land distances, truck transport becomes costly; rail transport can be significantly less costly to use.\n\nTransporting biomass by railcar has its challenges. Woody biomass takes many forms, shapes and sizes and can be a difficult-to-handle material, particularly getting it out of containers such as railcars.\n\nWood chip transport by railcar became popular in North America in the 60’s and 70’s with the determination that properly prepared sawmill residuals could be used for pulp chips.  Several hundred specially designed wood chip railcars were constructed and most of these railcars are still in use today.\n\nPulp chips make up the bulk of woody biomass being transported by rail in North America.  Pulp chips tend to be fairly uniform in size, but knit together after transport in box cars.  And, the chip moisture content can vary significantly, which can be a problem in very cold climates.  Wood chips will self-heat from biological action and oxidation if left to sit for awhile, and snow that might be sitting on top, melts and freezes at the bottom of the railcar.\n\nWood pellets are also transported by rail, more so as the world demand for pellets increases.\n\nIn BC, pulp chips and wood pellets are routinely transported hundreds of kilometers by rail from the BC interior to the ports in Vancouver and Prince Rupert for trans-loading onto ships.\n\n**Wood Chip Railcars**\n\n![](/images/Chip-Railcars-300x249.jpg)\n\nFigure 1 – Woodchip Gondola Railcars\n\nIn the southern US, bottom-dump railcars are used for transporting chips, but in wet or cold climates, chips will not flow easily out of bottom-dump hoppers and gates. Consequently, most woodchips in Canada and in the US northwest are transported in specially designed open-top, woodchip gondola cars, which have a door on the back-end, the intent being that a front-end loader can drive into the railcar to empty it or the railcar can be tipped-up on one end for emptying. The end door is hinged at the top and when closed is secured at the bottom with steel wedges. See the attached BC Rail Chip Gondola Car data sheet.\n\nThe woodchip gondola car has a box that is nominally 61’-6” long x 9’-10” wide x 10’-9” high with a volumetric capacity of 6,575 ft³.  Some cars are longer with sidewall extensions and can carry up to 7,100 ft³.  Because the chips are quite light, the maximum payload is approximately 28 bone-dry tonnes (BDt) and while the railcars can be heaping full when loaded, the maximum allowable gross rail load of 220,000 lbs is rarely achieved unless some form of \\`packing’ is utilized. Chip railcars that are not packed when being loaded will settle significantly during travel.\n\n**Chip Railcar Loading**\n\nChip railcars can be loaded by several means, including the following.\n\n![](/images/Rader-Wig-Wag-2a-300x242.jpg)\n\nRader Wig-Wag Pneumatic Railcar Loader\n\nPneumatic loaders – Some sawmills utilize pneumatic conveyors to transport the chips to a railcar loading station which is equipped with a \\`wig-wag’ pneumatic loader that is mounted in a hood that is lowered down onto the railcar.  The wig-wag is a curved nozzle on the end of a blowline that is directed down into the railcar and is swung from side-to-side, the intent being to pack the chips into the railcar, increasing the payload.  The big disadvantage of the pneumatic conveyor and wig-wag loader is significant chip damage and breakage due to the chips impacting the conveyor elbows and the railcar. Additionally, the pneumatic system has a high power requirement and can be quite dusty.\n\nFront-end Loaders – Some chip producers utilize front-end loaders (FEL’s) to load chip railcars.  The FEL scoops up a bucketful of chips from a storage pad, drives up a ramp alongside the railcar and dumps the bucket load into the car box.\n\n![](/images/Sunpine4a-298x300.jpg)\n\nFigure 2 – Sawmill Chip Bins\n\nOverhead Chip Bins – Most sawmills temporarily store their residual chips in overhead chip bins that can discharge either into trucks or open-top railcars.  Sawmill chip storage capacity is often limited, requiring that railcars be available at all times.\n\nBelt Conveyors – Belt conveyors are the least damaging method of conveying wood chips and some sawmills use them to transport the chips to the railcar loading station and discharge them via a chute into the railcar; however, without packing of some kind, the railcar payload is low. There are a few methods of compacting chips.\n\nAir blower assist – A few installations utilize a fan to blow air down the conveyor discharge chute, increasing the velocity of the chips entering the railcar, thereby increasing the compaction and payload. Compaction increases of 2-4% are reported.\n\nCar Shakers – Pneumatic car shakers can be used to shake the railcar sides during loading, the intent being to cause the chips to settle, and pack 2-3% more chips into the car.\n\nChip Flinger – Bailey Consulting has developed the \\`Chip Flinger’ as a method of compacting chips in contained vessels, including railcars, trucks and ships.  Their website claims compaction factors of 25-33%.\n\nChip Densifier – Materials Handling & Engineering Inc. developed the \\`Chip Densifier’ for compacting chips in railcars, trucks and ships.  Their advertising claims compaction factors up to 30%.\n\n![](/images/PGP-Trackmobile-1-300x173.jpg)\n\nFigure 3 – Trackmobile for Moving Railcars\n\nMoving Railcars When Being Loaded – Most railcar loading stations utilize stationary equipment, which necessitates moving the railcar under the loading point, in order to distribute the chip load along the length of the car.  There are several methods of moving railcars to and from the loading station and moving them back and forth under the loading mechanism:\n\n-   Railcar pullers consisting of wire rope winches.\n-   Front-end loaders with railcar knuckle attachments.\n-   Electro-hydraulic railcar positioners.\n-   Railcar movers such as \\`Shuttlewagons’ or \\`Trackmobiles’.\n\n**Chip Railcar Unloading**\n\nUnloading chip railcars effectively is much more difficult than loading railcars.  The chips may have been intentionally compacted during loading and during travel the chips will have consolidated even more, making them difficult to remove.  Additionally in cold climates, the chips will freeze into clumps and to the railcars. There are several methods for unloading chip railcars, including the following.\n\nPneumatic Unloaders – Pneumatic unloaders are available for unloading bulk materials from ships and railcars.  They are equipped with a rotating cutting head mounted on a negative pressure, vacuum system that is lowered into the material to be unloaded.  The rotating head loosens the packed material, which is picked-up by the vacuum and transported by the negative pressure conveyor to a cyclone where the material is separated from the transport air and is discharged via a rotary airlock into a conveyor system to storage.\n\nPneumatic unloaders are not the best choice for handling wood chips.  They have high power requirements, are very dusty, damage the chips, damage the railcars and are costly to maintain.\n\n![](/images/DSC00510a-300x165.jpg)\n\nFigure 4 – FEL Unloading Chip Railcars\n\nFront-end Loaders – Front-end loaders (FEL’s) can be used to empty chip railcars that have access doors at one end.  The unloading station consists of an unloading ramp located at one end of a rail siding.  The ramp is equipped with a hoist mounted on an overhead frame that will is used to open the up-swinging railcar door.\n\nThe front-end loader is a modified CAT 936G (or equal) with a 7 yd³ chip bucket.  The operator drives the front-end loader into the end of the railcar, scoops up a bucket load and backs out of the car, then turns, drives forward and discharges its chip load into an unloading hopper, which meters the chips into a conveyor system to storage.  The loader repeats this until the railcar is empty. After the railcar is unloaded, a rail car mover pulls the empty railcar out and pushes another full car in to the unloading station.  The front-end loader system would be capable of unloading 1-1½ railcars per hour depending upon weather and the degree of cleanliness the operator is attempting to achieve.  In winter, the throughput rate would be less.  The front-end loader is the best way of cleaning frozen chips out of a railcar.\n\n![](/images/4-Railcar-Dumper-6a-300x240.jpg)\n\nFigure 5 – Combination Truck / Railcar End-Tipper with Digger\n\nEnd-tippers – Railcar end-tippers were installed in several western mills in the 60’s and 70’s, when chip transport by rail became popular.  The end-tipper consists of a platform onto which the railcar is tipped on end to 63° to enable the chips to slide out of the end door into a receiving hopper.  The end-tipper consists of:\n\n-   A drive-over tipper deck with safety hoops, a movable back-stop and multi-stage hydraulic lift cylinders.\n-   A receiving hopper, and a drive-over bridge with hydraulic lift cylinders.\n-   Some form of railcar vibrator.\n-   Possibly an integral railcar scale.\n-   A hydraulic power unit\n\nA railcar mover is utilized to move a railcar onto the tipper deck and up against the backstop.  The operator replaces the steel door wedges with wooden wedges, opens the railcar bridge over the receiving hopper; and then proceeds to raise the tipper deck.\n\nWhen the deck raises high enough, the weight of the chips inside the railcar presses against the door causing the wooden wedges to shear, the door to open and the chips to flow out of the railcar into the receiving hopper.  The operator raises the tipper deck until all the chips have emptied out of the railcar.  If some chips are stuck inside the railcar, he can utilize a railcar vibrator to shake the car and loosen the chips.\n\nWhen the railcar is empty, the operator lowers the tipper deck back down, lowers the bridge, moves the backstop out of the way and reinstalls the steel wedges in the railcar door.  Then the railcar mover removes the empty car from the dumper, replacing it with a full car.  The railcar end-tipper can empty a maximum of 4 railcars per hour.\n\nCombination Truck / Railcar End-tippers\n\nSometimes the railcar dumper is incorporated into a combination truck / railcar dumper (TRD), which is designed for unloading both railcars and chip trucks.  These dumpers can have a deck up to 90’ long, in order to handle extended Super B-Train chip trucks.  See Figure 5.  Also see the article titled “Biomass Trucks and Dumpers” located elsewhere on this website.\n\nRoll-over Dumpers\n\n![](/images/wood-chips-freight-train-rail-car-unloading-at-wood-chip-terminal-BPYE2J-300x222.jpg)\n\nFigure 6 – Roll-Over Railcar Dumper\n\nRoll-over Dumpers are utilized extensively for unloading railcars transporting bulk materials such as coal and minerals, and in warm climates, a few are used for wood chips.  The roll-over dumper consists of a platform mounted in circular end-frames that ride on wheeled trunnions, which permit the platform to be rolled upside down by an electro-mechanical drive.  The frame has clamps that retain the railcar on the tracks when rolled-over.  The open-top railcar is pushed into the frame and the hold-down clamps applied.  The drive is activated and the frame and railcar are rolled over and the material discharged over the side and out the top of the inverted railcar, and into a live-bottom receiving hopper.  The throughput rate for chip railcars can be up to 6 cars per hour.  Roll-over dumpers are not suitable for handling biomass in low temperature climates where chips freeze into the railcars.\n\n![](/images/Knuckleboom-Chip-Unloader.jpg)\n\nFigure 7 – Knuckleboom Chip Unloader\n\nKnuckle-boom Unloaders – Knuckle-boom excavators equipped with a clamshell bucket are used in some installations for unloading gondola railcars.  The excavator can be the mobile, high-lift type and operate from alongside the railcars, discharging their bucket loads into trucks or into a metering hopper and conveyor system.  Fixed knuckle-boom unloaders can be mounted on a stationary frame that straddles the rail siding.  Railcars are pulled / pushed under the frame and the knuckle-boom unloads the chips into trucks or into a metering hopper and conveyor system. The knuckleboom unloader would be capable of unloading approximately 1 railcar per hour depending upon weather and the degree of cleanliness the operator is attempting to achieve.  In winter, the throughput rate would be less.\n\nFrozen Chips\n\n![](/images/9a-Dump-6-225x300.jpg)\n\nFigure 8 – Chips Frozen Into Railcar\n\nChips freezing into railcars is a big problem in cold climates and is one of the reasons that chip delivery by railcar has tended to fall out of favour in northern climates in the past few years.  Some cars end up with 15-20% of their payload capacity frozen into the railcars, travelling back and forth between the source mill and the end-user plant.  This results in loss of transport capacity and higher transport costs, as more railcars are required to move a given volume of chips.\n\nSeveral devices have been tried for loosening frozen chips.  The most common equipment is some form of vibratory device, including side vibrators and backstop vibrators. To be effective, it is necessary to get the vibrator position and orientation correct.\n\nSide vibrators are the most common but unfortunately they are not that efficient as their effect tends to be limited to the railcar sides with little vibration being transmitted to the railcar bottom where the frozen chips are located.  Backstop vibrators would be more effective, but that requires a design where the end of the railcar frame, and not the railcar knuckle, is butted firmly against the backstop.  On a recent project, bottom vibrators were proposed that would rise out of the dumper deck and contact the main railcar center-beam.\n\nRailcar Diggers\n\nChips frozen into railcars became such a problem that the \\`railcar digger’ was devised. See Figure 5.  It consists of a hydraulically operated knuckleboom arm mounted on a frame above the discharge end of a railcar end-tipper.  The digger is usually equipped with a scraper plate on the end. Once the railcar is tipped up on the end-tipper and it becomes apparent that there are frozen chips, the railcar tipper operator uses the arm to reach into the top of the railcar to scrape the frozen chips loose.  The digger is somewhat effective but using one greatly increases the time required to empty a railcar.  Additionally, the arm causes significant damage to the railcar as it reaches down between the railcar sidewall tie-beams to access the frozen chips.  It has been proposed that a telescopic scraper arm would give the operator better control resulting in effective railcar clean-up and less railcar damage.\n\n**Transporting Wastewood / Hog Fuel by Railcar**\n\nWastewood / hog fuel is not usually transported by railcar.  It is such a low-value material that it is not economical to do so.  Hog fuel is much harder to handle than wood chips, so the only practical way of unloading hog fuel from railcars would be with a front-end loader.\n\n**Transporting Wood Pellets by Railcar**\n\n![](/images/Fibreco-Roll-over-Railcar-Dumpera-300x196.jpg)\n\nFigure 9 – Closed Wood Pellet Gondola Car\n\nWood pellets have very good flow characteristics and are well suited to being transported by railcar.\n\nWood pellets are easily damaged by moisture so must be shipped in dry, closed, bottom-dump gondola cars.\n\nAlthough biological decay and oxidation is slowed-down by the low moisture content, off-gassing from pellets is an issue to be considered in closed railcars.\n\nPellet railcars are usually loaded directly from overhead pellet silos or from a conveyor system from the pellet storage silo.  Wood pellets are fragile, so care must be taken when handling them.\n\nWood pellets generate considerable amounts of very fine, explosive talc-like dust when handled, so dust control, spark, fire and explosion prevention, detection and suppression must be considered at the wood pellet loading and unloading facilities. Silo temperature and gas monitoring is also recommended.\n\nSome companies have experimented with transporting wood pellets in large fabric bags or in lined 20’ shipping containers.  Large fabric bags can be loaded into boxcars, and shipping containers can be carried on container cars.\n\n**Weighing Woody Biomass**\n\nThe amounts of woody biomass delivered to a plant usually needs to be measured for inventory or commercial purposes.  Railcar weighscales can be installed in the railyard to measure the weight of the railcars before and after emptying.  Some vendors install railcar weighscales directly on end-tippers; however, weighing the cars on the end-ripper increases the dumping time.  Also, these integral scales are subjected to a lot of abuse particularly from being tipped up to 63° and from the vibrators.\n\nThe amount of delivered woody biomass can also be measured by utilizing belt weighscales mounted on the belt conveyor that transports the chips from the tipper receiving hopper.\n\nYard railcar scales or belt weigh scales are recommended if the intent is to use the scale weight for commercial purposes.\n\n**Other Things to Consider**\n\nThere are several other things to consider when contemplating delivering woody biomass by rail.\n\nTrain Frequency and Size – Trains are not as dispatchable as are trucks; so, care must be taken to match the train delivery frequency and size with the requirements of the plant.\n\nRailyard – The railyard must be large enough to hold the largest anticipated train delivery, plus at least one extra track for storing empties, plus a \\`run-around’ track to permit the railcar mover to bypass the loaded tracks.\n\nRailcar Mover – The type and size of railcar mover is determined from the number of cars to be moved in the yard.\n\nRailcar Demurrage –  A certain amount of time will be included in the rail delivery contract for unloading. Demurrage is charged from the moment the allowable time has expired until the rail company picks up the empties. The railcar unloading rate must match the requirements of the plant, but should also be fast enough to avoid railcar demurrage charges.\n\nRail Transport Contracts – Most rail companies have strong unions that dictate railcar handling practices including loading and unloading. Rail transport companies are powerful entities that require long-term delivery / transport contracts. It is recommended that you negotiate a firm contract that satisfies your requirements before spending capital funds constructing railyards and loading and unloading systems.\n\nDust Control – Handling woody biomass is always dusty, which can present health, safety and environmental issues.  Fugitive dusting can be controlled by enclosing equipment, maintaining a negative pressure inside the equipment enclosure and cleaning the extracted air with a dust collector.  Asset protection measures including heat, spark, fire, explosion prevention, detection and suppression will be required to meet the authorities’ requirements.  Refer to the article titled _“__Biomass Plant Fire and Dust Explosion Control”_, included elsewhere on this website.\n\nChip Sampling – Your process may require taking samples from the railcars, in order to monitor chip quality.  Good material quality control relies on proper sampling, which must be accurate and precise and must truly represent the main body of material. Without good sampling, quality control is based on false information. Tail-gate sampling from the backs of trucks and railcars is not accurate or precise and does not represent the main body of material.  Refer to the article titled _“Requirements for Chip Sampling”_, included elsewhere on this website.\n\nCopywrite © December 2016\n\n**References**\n\n“Chip Flinger”, Bailey Consulting Inc., [www.chipflinger.com](http://www.chipflinger.com)\n\n“Densifier”, Material Handling & Engineering Inc., [http://mhedensifier.com/Index.html](http://mhedensifier.com/Index.html)\n\n“Rotary Rail Dumpers”, Metso, [http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/MaTobox7.nsf/DocsByID/C0403CB2E6D59EE685256D1F0067936B/$File/RCD.pdf](http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/MaTobox7.nsf/DocsByID/C0403CB2E6D59EE685256D1F0067936B/$File/RCD.pdf)\n\nEnd-Tipper / Dumper, Megatech Engineering Ltd.,   [http://www.megatech-engineering.com/](http://www.megatech-engineering.com/)\n\n**About the Author**\n\nPaul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

However, woody biomass is light and bulky and when transporting large volumes over long land distances, truck transport becomes costly; rail transport can be significantly less costly to use.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Transporting biomass by railcar has its challenges. Woody biomass takes many forms, shapes and sizes and can be a difficult-to-handle material, particularly getting it out of containers such as railcars.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wood chip transport by railcar became popular in North America in the 60’s and 70’s with the determination that properly prepared sawmill residuals could be used for pulp chips.  Several hundred specially designed wood chip railcars were constructed and most of these railcars are still in use today.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pulp chips make up the bulk of woody biomass being transported by rail in North America.  Pulp chips tend to be fairly uniform in size, but knit together after transport in box cars.  And, the chip moisture content can vary significantly, which can be a problem in very cold climates.  Wood chips will self-heat from biological action and oxidation if left to sit for awhile, and snow that might be sitting on top, melts and freezes at the bottom of the railcar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wood pellets are also transported by rail, more so as the world demand for pellets increases.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In BC, pulp chips and wood pellets are routinely transported hundreds of kilometers by rail from the BC interior to the ports in Vancouver and Prince Rupert for trans-loading onto ships.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Wood Chip Railcars\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/Chip-Railcars-300x249.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 1 – Woodchip Gondola Railcars\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the southern US, bottom-dump railcars are used for transporting chips, but in wet or cold climates, chips will not flow easily out of bottom-dump hoppers and gates. Consequently, most woodchips in Canada and in the US northwest are transported in specially designed open-top, woodchip gondola cars, which have a door on the back-end, the intent being that a front-end loader can drive into the railcar to empty it or the railcar can be tipped-up on one end for emptying. The end door is hinged at the top and when closed is secured at the bottom with steel wedges. See the attached BC Rail Chip Gondola Car data sheet.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The woodchip gondola car has a box that is nominally 61’-6” long x 9’-10” wide x 10’-9” high with a volumetric capacity of 6,575 ft³.  Some cars are longer with sidewall extensions and can carry up to 7,100 ft³.  Because the chips are quite light, the maximum payload is approximately 28 bone-dry tonnes (BDt) and while the railcars can be heaping full when loaded, the maximum allowable gross rail load of 220,000 lbs is rarely achieved unless some form of `packing’ is utilized. Chip railcars that are not packed when being loaded will settle significantly during travel.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Chip Railcar Loading\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chip railcars can be loaded by several means, including the following.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/Rader-Wig-Wag-2a-300x242.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rader Wig-Wag Pneumatic Railcar Loader\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pneumatic loaders – Some sawmills utilize pneumatic conveyors to transport the chips to a railcar loading station which is equipped with a `wig-wag’ pneumatic loader that is mounted in a hood that is lowered down onto the railcar.  The wig-wag is a curved nozzle on the end of a blowline that is directed down into the railcar and is swung from side-to-side, the intent being to pack the chips into the railcar, increasing the payload.  The big disadvantage of the pneumatic conveyor and wig-wag loader is significant chip damage and breakage due to the chips impacting the conveyor elbows and the railcar. Additionally, the pneumatic system has a high power requirement and can be quite dusty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Front-end Loaders – Some chip producers utilize front-end loaders (FEL’s) to load chip railcars.  The FEL scoops up a bucketful of chips from a storage pad, drives up a ramp alongside the railcar and dumps the bucket load into the car box.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/Sunpine4a-298x300.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 2 – Sawmill Chip Bins\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Overhead Chip Bins – Most sawmills temporarily store their residual chips in overhead chip bins that can discharge either into trucks or open-top railcars.  Sawmill chip storage capacity is often limited, requiring that railcars be available at all times.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Belt Conveyors – Belt conveyors are the least damaging method of conveying wood chips and some sawmills use them to transport the chips to the railcar loading station and discharge them via a chute into the railcar; however, without packing of some kind, the railcar payload is low. There are a few methods of compacting chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Air blower assist – A few installations utilize a fan to blow air down the conveyor discharge chute, increasing the velocity of the chips entering the railcar, thereby increasing the compaction and payload. Compaction increases of 2-4% are reported.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Car Shakers – Pneumatic car shakers can be used to shake the railcar sides during loading, the intent being to cause the chips to settle, and pack 2-3% more chips into the car.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chip Flinger – Bailey Consulting has developed the `Chip Flinger’ as a method of compacting chips in contained vessels, including railcars, trucks and ships.  Their website claims compaction factors of 25-33%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chip Densifier – Materials Handling &#x26; Engineering Inc. developed the `Chip Densifier’ for compacting chips in railcars, trucks and ships.  Their advertising claims compaction factors up to 30%.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/PGP-Trackmobile-1-300x173.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 3 – Trackmobile for Moving Railcars\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Moving Railcars When Being Loaded – Most railcar loading stations utilize stationary equipment, which necessitates moving the railcar under the loading point, in order to distribute the chip load along the length of the car.  There are several methods of moving railcars to and from the loading station and moving them back and forth under the loading mechanism:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Railcar pullers consisting of wire rope winches.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Front-end loaders with railcar knuckle attachments.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Electro-hydraulic railcar positioners.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Railcar movers such as `Shuttlewagons’ or `Trackmobiles’.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Chip Railcar Unloading\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Unloading chip railcars effectively is much more difficult than loading railcars.  The chips may have been intentionally compacted during loading and during travel the chips will have consolidated even more, making them difficult to remove.  Additionally in cold climates, the chips will freeze into clumps and to the railcars. There are several methods for unloading chip railcars, including the following.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pneumatic Unloaders – Pneumatic unloaders are available for unloading bulk materials from ships and railcars.  They are equipped with a rotating cutting head mounted on a negative pressure, vacuum system that is lowered into the material to be unloaded.  The rotating head loosens the packed material, which is picked-up by the vacuum and transported by the negative pressure conveyor to a cyclone where the material is separated from the transport air and is discharged via a rotary airlock into a conveyor system to storage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pneumatic unloaders are not the best choice for handling wood chips.  They have high power requirements, are very dusty, damage the chips, damage the railcars and are costly to maintain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/DSC00510a-300x165.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 4 – FEL Unloading Chip Railcars\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Front-end Loaders – Front-end loaders (FEL’s) can be used to empty chip railcars that have access doors at one end.  The unloading station consists of an unloading ramp located at one end of a rail siding.  The ramp is equipped with a hoist mounted on an overhead frame that will is used to open the up-swinging railcar door.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The front-end loader is a modified CAT 936G (or equal) with a 7 yd³ chip bucket.  The operator drives the front-end loader into the end of the railcar, scoops up a bucket load and backs out of the car, then turns, drives forward and discharges its chip load into an unloading hopper, which meters the chips into a conveyor system to storage.  The loader repeats this until the railcar is empty. After the railcar is unloaded, a rail car mover pulls the empty railcar out and pushes another full car in to the unloading station.  The front-end loader system would be capable of unloading 1-1½ railcars per hour depending upon weather and the degree of cleanliness the operator is attempting to achieve.  In winter, the throughput rate would be less.  The front-end loader is the best way of cleaning frozen chips out of a railcar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/4-Railcar-Dumper-6a-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 5 – Combination Truck / Railcar End-Tipper with Digger\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>End-tippers – Railcar end-tippers were installed in several western mills in the 60’s and 70’s, when chip transport by rail became popular.  The end-tipper consists of a platform onto which the railcar is tipped on end to 63° to enable the chips to slide out of the end door into a receiving hopper.  The end-tipper consists of:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>A drive-over tipper deck with safety hoops, a movable back-stop and multi-stage hydraulic lift cylinders.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A receiving hopper, and a drive-over bridge with hydraulic lift cylinders.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Some form of railcar vibrator.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Possibly an integral railcar scale.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A hydraulic power unit\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>A railcar mover is utilized to move a railcar onto the tipper deck and up against the backstop.  The operator replaces the steel door wedges with wooden wedges, opens the railcar bridge over the receiving hopper; and then proceeds to raise the tipper deck.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the deck raises high enough, the weight of the chips inside the railcar presses against the door causing the wooden wedges to shear, the door to open and the chips to flow out of the railcar into the receiving hopper.  The operator raises the tipper deck until all the chips have emptied out of the railcar.  If some chips are stuck inside the railcar, he can utilize a railcar vibrator to shake the car and loosen the chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the railcar is empty, the operator lowers the tipper deck back down, lowers the bridge, moves the backstop out of the way and reinstalls the steel wedges in the railcar door.  Then the railcar mover removes the empty car from the dumper, replacing it with a full car.  The railcar end-tipper can empty a maximum of 4 railcars per hour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Combination Truck / Railcar End-tippers\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes the railcar dumper is incorporated into a combination truck / railcar dumper (TRD), which is designed for unloading both railcars and chip trucks.  These dumpers can have a deck up to 90’ long, in order to handle extended Super B-Train chip trucks.  See Figure 5.  Also see the article titled “Biomass Trucks and Dumpers” located elsewhere on this website.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Roll-over Dumpers\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/wood-chips-freight-train-rail-car-unloading-at-wood-chip-terminal-BPYE2J-300x222.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 6 – Roll-Over Railcar Dumper\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Roll-over Dumpers are utilized extensively for unloading railcars transporting bulk materials such as coal and minerals, and in warm climates, a few are used for wood chips.  The roll-over dumper consists of a platform mounted in circular end-frames that ride on wheeled trunnions, which permit the platform to be rolled upside down by an electro-mechanical drive.  The frame has clamps that retain the railcar on the tracks when rolled-over.  The open-top railcar is pushed into the frame and the hold-down clamps applied.  The drive is activated and the frame and railcar are rolled over and the material discharged over the side and out the top of the inverted railcar, and into a live-bottom receiving hopper.  The throughput rate for chip railcars can be up to 6 cars per hour.  Roll-over dumpers are not suitable for handling biomass in low temperature climates where chips freeze into the railcars.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/Knuckleboom-Chip-Unloader.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 7 – Knuckleboom Chip Unloader\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Knuckle-boom Unloaders – Knuckle-boom excavators equipped with a clamshell bucket are used in some installations for unloading gondola railcars.  The excavator can be the mobile, high-lift type and operate from alongside the railcars, discharging their bucket loads into trucks or into a metering hopper and conveyor system.  Fixed knuckle-boom unloaders can be mounted on a stationary frame that straddles the rail siding.  Railcars are pulled / pushed under the frame and the knuckle-boom unloads the chips into trucks or into a metering hopper and conveyor system. The knuckleboom unloader would be capable of unloading approximately 1 railcar per hour depending upon weather and the degree of cleanliness the operator is attempting to achieve.  In winter, the throughput rate would be less.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Frozen Chips\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/9a-Dump-6-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 8 – Chips Frozen Into Railcar\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chips freezing into railcars is a big problem in cold climates and is one of the reasons that chip delivery by railcar has tended to fall out of favour in northern climates in the past few years.  Some cars end up with 15-20% of their payload capacity frozen into the railcars, travelling back and forth between the source mill and the end-user plant.  This results in loss of transport capacity and higher transport costs, as more railcars are required to move a given volume of chips.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Several devices have been tried for loosening frozen chips.  The most common equipment is some form of vibratory device, including side vibrators and backstop vibrators. To be effective, it is necessary to get the vibrator position and orientation correct.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Side vibrators are the most common but unfortunately they are not that efficient as their effect tends to be limited to the railcar sides with little vibration being transmitted to the railcar bottom where the frozen chips are located.  Backstop vibrators would be more effective, but that requires a design where the end of the railcar frame, and not the railcar knuckle, is butted firmly against the backstop.  On a recent project, bottom vibrators were proposed that would rise out of the dumper deck and contact the main railcar center-beam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Railcar Diggers\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Chips frozen into railcars became such a problem that the `railcar digger’ was devised. See Figure 5.  It consists of a hydraulically operated knuckleboom arm mounted on a frame above the discharge end of a railcar end-tipper.  The digger is usually equipped with a scraper plate on the end. Once the railcar is tipped up on the end-tipper and it becomes apparent that there are frozen chips, the railcar tipper operator uses the arm to reach into the top of the railcar to scrape the frozen chips loose.  The digger is somewhat effective but using one greatly increases the time required to empty a railcar.  Additionally, the arm causes significant damage to the railcar as it reaches down between the railcar sidewall tie-beams to access the frozen chips.  It has been proposed that a telescopic scraper arm would give the operator better control resulting in effective railcar clean-up and less railcar damage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Transporting Wastewood / Hog Fuel by Railcar\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wastewood / hog fuel is not usually transported by railcar.  It is such a low-value material that it is not economical to do so.  Hog fuel is much harder to handle than wood chips, so the only practical way of unloading hog fuel from railcars would be with a front-end loader.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Transporting Wood Pellets by Railcar\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/images/Fibreco-Roll-over-Railcar-Dumpera-300x196.jpg\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Figure 9 – Closed Wood Pellet Gondola Car\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wood pellets have very good flow characteristics and are well suited to being transported by railcar.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wood pellets are easily damaged by moisture so must be shipped in dry, closed, bottom-dump gondola cars.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although biological decay and oxidation is slowed-down by the low moisture content, off-gassing from pellets is an issue to be considered in closed railcars.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Pellet railcars are usually loaded directly from overhead pellet silos or from a conveyor system from the pellet storage silo.  Wood pellets are fragile, so care must be taken when handling them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Wood pellets generate considerable amounts of very fine, explosive talc-like dust when handled, so dust control, spark, fire and explosion prevention, detection and suppression must be considered at the wood pellet loading and unloading facilities.

Tail-gate sampling from the backs of trucks and railcars is not accurate or precise and does not represent the main body of material.  Refer to the article titled \u003Cem>“Requirements for Chip Sampling”\u003C/em>, included elsewhere on this website.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Copywrite © December 2016\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>References\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Chip Flinger”, Bailey Consulting Inc., \u003Ca href=\"http://www.chipflinger.com\">www.chipflinger.com\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Densifier”, Material Handling &#x26; Engineering Inc., \u003Ca href=\"http://mhedensifier.com/Index.html\">http://mhedensifier.com/Index.html\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Rotary Rail Dumpers”, Metso, \u003Ca href=\"http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/MaTobox7.nsf/DocsByID/C0403CB2E6D59EE685256D1F0067936B/$File/RCD.pdf\">http://www.metso.com/miningandconstruction/MaTobox7.nsf/DocsByID/C0403CB2E6D59EE685256D1F0067936B/$File/RCD.pdf\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>End-Tipper / Dumper, Megatech Engineering Ltd.,   \u003Ca href=\"http://www.megatech-engineering.com/\">http://www.megatech-engineering.com/\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>About the Author\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Paul Janzé has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.
