Care must be taken in the design of your biomass handling system.",["Date","2010-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"],[89,90,91,92],"biomass handling","system design","hog fuel","wood pellets","*This article was published under the title \"Move Your Biomass\" as the cover story in the May – June 2010 issue of Canadian Biomass Magazine.*\n\nBiomass is not an easy material to handle. It appears in a myriad of species, forms and sizes; it knits together, doesn't flow well, consolidates and packs easily; it can have a wide range of moisture contents, basic and bulk densities and calorific values; it will freeze; it is very dusty, catches fire easily and is self-combustible; it can contain all manner of contaminants. Conversely, wood pellets are uniform in size and moisture content, are very free flowing, but are quite fragile and easily degrade and require special handling.\n\nIncreasing numbers of power utilities are eyeing biomass as a source of fuel, primarily as a means of lowering CO2 emissions. New biomass boilers are being constructed but many coal-fired boilers are being converted for co-firing biomass or converted to 100% biomass. Biomass can be introduced into combustors as 'hog fuel', wood pellets or injected as a powder.\n\nWorking in the forest and converting the wood into usable products is part of the Canadian heritage. There are many people and companies who have extensive experience handling woody biomass in all its myriad of forms. However, with the recent rush to 'green energy' and the identification of woody biomass as a green fuel, there are a lot of interested and well-intentioned but woefully inexperienced people vying for various grants and proposing new projects, but who have little or no experience with biomass.\n\nCare must be taken in the design of your biomass handling system whatever the form. The topic of design is as varied and complex as the material and the intent in this article is to cover woody biomass, in the form of hog fuel and pellets, which is utilized as fuel.\n\n## Key Design Considerations\n\nA general tendency in most projects is to view the biomass handling system as the least glamorous part of the processing facility and it is the area where most people try to cut costs. In any project it is imperative to minimize costs, but the biomass processing system is not always the best place to do so.\n\nThe purpose of a biomass processing and handling system is to produce a boiler feedstock that is consistent in constituents, size and moisture content. Depending upon the variety and form of the raw incoming material, processing systems can be quite complex.\n\nThere are many factors that affect the design of the biomass system, including:\n\n### Type of Facility\n\nThe requirements for a facility that generates power for sale and must run 24 hours per day, 350 days per year at >95% uptime are much more rigorous than for a facility that utilizes the energy in-house and doesn't suffer punitive damages from being off-line. A power producer must guarantee reliability, therefore his fuel handling systems must be reliable and in some cases redundant.\n\n### Capital Cost\n\nGenerally, the cost of the biomass handling system is not a constant percentage of the cost of whole facility; the smaller the size of the whole facility, the greater the percentage of cost of the fuel handling system in relation to the cost of the whole facility. Hence, there is greater pressure to reduce costs and often this results in an inferior biomass handling system.\n\n### Location and Space\n\nA facility that is located within a city or town will likely be required to meet stricter environmental conditions than one isolated in the country, possibly including an enclosed biomass handling system and an odour control system.\n\nBiomass handling and storage requires considerable space. However, biomass-fired facilities are often located adjacent to other existing facilities and space can be at a premium. The available space has a tremendous impact on layout and layout affects process operability and capital cost.\n\n### Incoming Material\n\nFor this article, it is assumed that the incoming material will be pre-processed hog fuel either as residuals from wood products plants or as hogged forest residues; or wood pellets. If possible, establish a hog fuel quality specification with your biomass suppliers; one that will have material, size, moisture content, and contaminant specifications.\n\n### Required Quality of Hog Fuel\n\nIf the quality and form of the incoming material is quite different from that of the required combustor fuel, then suitable processing equipment will be required on site. It is my experience that the quality of incoming material will not always be as specified and you must have the ability to deal with sub-quality material arriving on site.\n\n### Delivery Method and Timing\n\nHow the material is delivered to the plant site has a big impact on the biomass handling system. The systems required for truck, rail and barge receiving and unloading are each quite different and affect the layout, cost and process.\n\n### Climate\n\nThe biomass handling system for a facility located in northern Canada is much different from one located on the west coast or from one in the southern USA. So, make sure your system designer has the appropriate experience.\n\n## Essential System Components\n\nGenerally, a hog fuel handling system requires the following sub-systems:\n\n### Delivery / Receiving System\n\nThe design of a truck receiving system depends upon the type of truck being used to haul the biomass. Trucks can be self-unloading or non-self unloading. Trucks can vary in size from a single trailer to Super B-Trains. Additionally, trucks tend to come during the daylight hours, so the system must be designed to handle the peak flow.\n\n*[Article continues with detailed technical specifications and system requirements...]*","src/content/posts/biomass-handling-system-design-things-to-consider.md","1d6df66fd569c7e1",{"html":97,"metadata":98},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>This article was published under the title “Move Your Biomass” as the cover story in the May – June 2010 issue of Canadian Biomass Magazine.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Biomass is not an easy material to handle.

And to ensure good quality fuel, good sampling procedures must be followed.\n\nWoody biomass in chip form has been utilized by the pulp and paper industry for many decades and chip quality has long been recognized as having an important effect on pulp quality; to make good pulp you need good chips. Likewise for a biomass-fired plant to operate efficiently, it needs a reliable, constant supply of consistent quality fuel.\n\nThis article was originally written with the pulp and paper industry in mind; however, the fundamentals of sampling wood chips also apply to the requirements of sampling biomass to be utilized as fuel.\n\nIn the past couple of decades, two opposing phenomena have emerged concerning the fibre supply for pulp and paper mills.\n\n- The supply of wood chips has shifted dramatically from high quality, whole log chips produced by a pulpmill woodroom, to residual chips from other processing industries, primarily sawmills. Residual chips can present considerable problems to the pulp mills.\n\n- The pulp mills have long known that wood chips of a certain size and configuration produce a better wood pulp and have been demanding a better quality product from their fibre suppliers.\n\nConsequently, quality control of chip supply has become more important and more difficult as most mills have multiple sources for their fibre.\n\nGood quality control relies on proper sampling, which must be accurate and precise and must truly represent the main body of chips. Without good sampling, quality control is based on false information. Bulk materials are difficult to sample properly on a production basis. Manual sampling can be done but it is labor intensive, prone to errors and does not easily fit into a production environment.\n\nCollecting samples of wood chips is one task in the mill that is not always done well. Unless the sample is taken properly, it will not be a true representation of the main product flow.\n\n### Literature on Sampling\n\nA review of the literature regarding wood chip sampling reveals that there is not a lot of good information available regarding the requirements for the actual collecting of chip samples on a production basis. Most of the literature deals with the laboratory preparation of the chip sample.\n\nThe Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) standard T 257 cm-02 titled \"Sampling and Preparing Wood for Analysis\" provides instructions for the laboratory production of wood samples and does not consider the collection of samples on a production basis.\n\nThe Scandinavian Pulp, Paper and Board Testing Committee standard SCAN-CM 41:89, \"Wood Chips for Pulp Production\", provides a basic description of the requirements for chip sampling, but focuses on the manual collection of chips.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 3129:1975 \"Wood Sampling Methods and General Requirements for Physical and Mechanical Tests\" does not consider sampling wood in chip form.\n\nThe aggregate and coal industries have developed excellent standards for the collection of samples of bulk materials on a production basis. The best description of sampling requirements is provided by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D2234-02, \"Standard Practice for Collection of a Gross Sample of Coal\". While the ASTM standard is written for coal sampling, it provides an excellent description of the fundamentals of sampling a bulk product in general. Much of the procedure is applicable to wood chip sampling.\n\nThis article relies heavily on the ASTM standard D2234-02 for general sample collecting procedures and on SCAN-CM 41:89 for specific wood sampling requirements.\n\nThe intent of this article is to summarize the requirements that must be met in order to provide representative chip sampling and to do so in an easily understood and achievable manner. This article does not consider chip classification or analysis.\n\n## 1. Terminology\n\n**Lot or Consignment** – a quantity of material being sampled; can be a continuous flow or delivered in discrete quantities by truck, railcar or barge.\n\n**Increment Sample or Spot Sample** – one sample taken manually or by a sampling device.\n\n**Gross Sample** – a sample representing one lot of material and made up of a number of 'increment' samples.\n\n**Representative Sample** – The gross sample must present a true representation of the main body of biomass within certain statistical limits. To do so, requires a repeatable sampling process that has specific requirements regarding the sampling conditions.\n\n**Fractionation** – separating bulk material according to its constituent sizes, whether naturally or inadvertently.\n\n## 2. Representative Samples\n\nA single spot sample generally is less likely to be representative of the main body of biomass than is a gross sample, which is a mixture of multiple spot samples.\n\n## 3. Classification of Sampling Techniques\n\nThe quality of the sample depends upon:\n\n- The type of selection (involving discretion)\n- The conditions under which the samples are collected\n- The method of spacing of the samples (location and/or time)\n\nThese designations can be applied to any sampling technique and help to distinguish those which provide the most representative sample.\n\n### 3.1. Type of Selection\n\n**Type I** – no human discretion is used.\n\n**Type II** – human discretion is used.\n\nType I generally provides a more accurate sample.\n\n### 3.2. Conditions of Sample Collection\n\n**Condition A, Stopped Belt Cut (Reference Method)** – taking a full cross-section cut of biomass from off of a stopped conveyor belt.\n\n**Condition B, Full Stream Cut** – taking a full cross-section cut of material from a falling stream of biomass.\n\n**Condition C, Partial Stream Cut** – only taking a part of the cross-section of falling stream of biomass.\n\n**Condition D, Stationary Sampling** – taking a sample from a stationary pile or container of biomass.\n\nGenerally, the stopped belt cut provides the best sample and the stationary sampling the poorest sample.\n\n### 3.3. Sample Spacing\n\n**Spacing 1, Systematic** – samples are taken evenly spaced in time or location from the lot of biomass.\n\n**Spacing 2, Random** – samples are taken randomly spaced in time or location from the lot of biomass.\n\nSystematic Spacing generally provides better results.\n\n## 4. Features of Good Sampling\n\n**Accuracy** – the ability to obtain sample increments which represent the true nature of the biomass supply.\n\n**Precision** – a statistical term relating to the number of sample increments (spot samples) taken from a lot or consignment.\n\nBiomass is a highly variable product and requires a large number of samples in order to establish sampling precision.\n\nPrecision cannot be increased by increasing the size of the spot / increment sample.\n\nPrecision can only be increased by increasing the number of spot / increment samples.\n\n## 5. Sampling Bias\n\nSize, shape and moisture content can vary dramatically throughout one lot or consignment.\n\nPoor sampling can induce systematic errors that skew the results. Two common errors are:\n\n- Spot samples are taken where certain properties are over-represented. eg. – at tail-gate of a chip truck where fines have settled to the bottom.\n- The sample device is not capable of taking a representative sample. ie. – the sample device is too small and either rejects large pieces or overflows.\n\nProperly designed, operated and maintained automatic samplers can minimize systematic sampling bias.\n\n### 5.1. Fractionation\n\nFractionation or particle separation can occur from the way in which biomass is loaded / stacked and the way in which it is transported. eg. – fines will settle down to the bottom of a chip truck over a long haul.\n\nAdditionally, fractionation can be produced by the sampling device itself; either by rejecting oversize pieces, failing to pick-up small particles, selectively picking up small particles, or breaking up particles by the sampling motion itself.\n\nStationary material is not uniform due to fractionation where material stratifies according to size. In order to get a representative gross sample from stationary material, a large number of increment or spot samples are required.\n\n## 6. Establishing Sampling Procedures / Selecting Equipment\n\nEstablishing sampling procedures and selecting sampling devices require an understanding of:\n\n1. The nature and variability of the material being sampled.\n2. The number and size of sample increments required.\n3. The best, practical sample collection method to be used.\n4. The distribution of the sample through the whole lot.\n5. The dimensions of the sampling device.\n6. The characteristics and movement of the sampling device\n7. Impediments to collection\n8. Preservation of moisture content\n9. Contamination\n10. Mechanical features of the sampling device\n11. Personnel\n12. Location of Equipment\n13. Criteria of Performance\n14. Sample Handling and Storage\n15. A process for reducing the gross sample size to the required laboratory size\n\n### 6.1. Material Being Sampled\n\nBiomass is highly variable in size, configuration and moisture content. It is relatively fragile and size is an extremely important factor, so care must be taken not to break the biomass unnecessarily during sampling.\n\n### 6.2. Number and Size of Samples\n\nThis depends upon the variability of the biomass and is usually determined by the plant technical department based on historical statistical results.\n\nWhere new sources are coming on line, it can be expected that the number of samples required will be greater than for established sources, where historical data is available.\n\nNormal sample size required in the lab is 8-10 litres (~0.35 ft³).\n\n### 6.3. Sample Collection Method\n\nThe best practical method should be used. The 'stopped-belt, full-cut' method is the best, but is not practical.\n\nThe 'falling stream, full-cut' or 'partial cut' are the next best methods.\n\n### 6.4. Sample Distribution Through Lot\n\nSample increments must be distributed through the whole volume of the lot, so that any one particle has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nThis is particularly important where 'fractionation' has occurred due to fines segregation to one part of the lot / consignment.\n\n### 6.5. Sampling Device Dimensions\n\nThe opening must be large enough so as not to reject the largest possible piece.\n\nThe capacity must be large enough to completely contain the sample without spillage.\n\n### 6.6. Characteristics and Movement of Sampling Device\n\nThere should be no rejection by size of material or movement of the device through the material.\n\nThere should be no contamination of the sample by the device.\n\nThe sample device should not damage or break up the biomass in the sample.\n\nPreferably, the sample device will pass through the entire cross-section of the stream so that each particle has an equal chance of being selected; or at least through a partial section that will contain all particle sizes within the stream.\n\nDevice speed through the flow is critical as the device must not block the flow of material. Eg. – a 48\" belt conveyor at 500 fpm delivers 16.3 ft³/sec of material. To extract 1ft³ of biomass, means the device must pass through the stream in less than a tenth of a second.\n\n### 6.7. Structural Impediments\n\nThere shall be no structural impediments that block either the collection of the sample or the flow of the material.\n\n### 6.8. Preservation of Moisture Content\n\nThe sampling device / method shall neither dry the biomass out or add moisture.\n\n### 6.9. Contamination\n\nThe device shall not contaminate the sample with foreign material or with unrelated biomass that will bias the results.\n\n### 6.10. Mechanical Features\n\nThe sampling device shall be non-clogging, self-cleaning and shall be designed to facilitate inspection and maintenance.\n\nIdeally, it will not be complex or costly to purchase and maintain.\n\n### 6.11. Personnel\n\nSampling personnel shall be properly trained and qualified; particularly where manual chip samples are collected.\n\n### 6.12. Location of Sampling Equipment\n\nEquipment shall be located where:\n\n- It can effectively take a representative sample.\n- It is convenient and readily accessible for sample taking.\n- It is readily accessible for maintenance and inspection.\n\n### 6.13. Criteria of Sampling Performance\n\nSampling procedures and equipment must be routinely monitored to ensure that the samples being collected are:\n\n- Unbiased\n- Accurate\n- Provide the degree of precision required\n- Representative of the whole lot\n\nIn addition, a constant sampling ratio should be maintained; ie. – constant volume or weight of sample as compared to the whole lot.\n\n### 6.14. Sample Handling\n\nChip samples once collected must be:\n\n- Clearly labeled and identified\n- Sealed in moisture-proof containers\n- Stored in a cool, dry place\n\nSamples properly stored in this manner can be kept in storage for up to 36 hours with no appreciable moisture loss.\n\n### 6.15. Gross Sample Size Reduction\n\nNormal increment sample size as collected will be 8-10 litres (average bucket size); therefore, combined multiple increments (the gross sample) must be reduced down to the laboratory sample size in a manner that retains biomass representative of the whole lot.\n\nLarge gross samples shall be thoroughly mixed before being reduced to laboratory sample size.\n\nAlternatively, large sample increments can themselves be sampled or split before being combined into the gross sample.\n\nLarge samples can be reduced in size by mixing thoroughly and coning and quartering or by the use of an automatic splitter.\n\n## 7. Maintenance of Sampling Equipment\n\nSampling equipment must be safely and readily accessible to enable inspection, cleaning and maintenance.\n\nWorn mechanical sampling equipment can produce biased results, therefore it is imperative that equipment is inspected, repaired when necessary, and the performance measured regularly.\n\n## 8. Design of Sampling Equipment\n\nThere are many 'off-the-shelf' product samplers; most of which were designed for materials other than biomass. However, it is the author's experience that the best sampling equipment is custom designed to meet the specific requirements of the chip sampling application considering the sampling requirements described in this paper, the product being handled, and the physical and operational constraints.\n\n## Summary\n\nTo be of value, biomass samples need to be unbiased, accurate, precise and representative of the main lot or consignment of biomass.\n\nBiomass is highly variable in size, configuration and moisture content and is prone to fractionation and stratification, which complicate the sampling procedure.\n\nSingle spot / increment samples of biomass tend not to be accurate or representative of the main lot / consignment, particularly those samples taken from stationary loads or piles where fractionation has occurred.\n\n### Common Sampling Errors\n\nTwo common sampling errors, which bias results are:\n\n- Spot samples are taken where certain properties are over-represented. eg. – at the tail-gate of a chip truck where fines have settled to the bottom.\n- The sample device is not capable of taking a representative sample. ie. – the sample device is too small and either rejects large pieces or overflows.\n\n### Best Practical Sampling Procedures\n\nThe best, practical chip sampling procedures and equipment have the following features:\n\n- Human discretion is minimized.\n- Full-stream cut or partial-stream cut sampling is employed.\n- Samples are taken systematically in time and /or location throughout the whole volume of the main lot / consignment.\n- They do not introduce bias or contaminants into the sample.\n- They are convenient to use.\n- Preferably, they automatically reduce the gross sample to the laboratory sample size.\n- Preferably, they have low capital and maintenance costs.\n\nIt is not easy to achieve all of these objectives, however, the primary goals of accuracy, precision and representativeness must take precedence.\n\nConvenience and cost, while important, are secondary considerations.\n\n## About the Author\n\nPaul has more than 30 years experience in engineering design, project management, equipment manufacturing and maintenance, primarily in the forest products and energy industries.

Or, your friend has spotted a market opportunity. All you have to do is build a plant and start producing. \"Build it and they will come.\" Sounds simple. How can you miss?\n\nEasily, I must say. The days are long gone when developing a project was as simple as pitching an idea to a bank, getting some cash, building a plant and selling your product.\n\nWith the current emphasis on producing 'green energy' from biomass and the subsequent government grants and subsidies available to promote the idea, a lot of well-meaning but inexperienced entrepreneurs are promoting the construction of plants that will process biomass into one form or another.\n\nThere are some basic steps that all projects go through, from concept to start-up, whether the 'builder' is new to the process or whether it is a company with a well formulated plan for development. Following is a brief description of the project development process.\n\n## Project Phases\n\nThe actual identified project development steps may vary in number depending upon the developer; some can be combined but most projects usually include the following phases in one form or another:\n\n**Phase 1 – Pre-feasibility:** a market opportunity is identified and rough costs and possible profits established\n\n**Phase 2 – Feasibility:** the market opportunity is analyzed; concept process alternatives developed for meeting the opportunity; challenges identified; order of magnitude capital cost estimates (CCE) developed; and one or two process alternatives selected for further development.\n\n**Phase 3 – Definition:** discussions are initiated with potential suppliers, customers, financiers, regulating bodies, environmental groups and other stakeholders; a plant location selected; plant layouts developed in sketch form; a Class 25 CCE developed for the selected alternatives; a final alternative selected for development; and a plan for project execution is established.\n\n**Phase 4 – Budget Development:** on-going discussions with potential suppliers, customers, financiers, regulating bodies, and other stakeholders, the intent being to establish memorandums of understanding (MOU's) with each party; sufficient engineering done to support the development of a Class 10 Budget CCE; preliminary discussions with potential contractors.\n\n**Phase 5 – Detail Design:** MOU's in place with suppliers and customers; financing is in place; permitting well under way; detail engineering completed for all disciplines; procurement and contracting processes started; major purchases made; Class 5 Accounting CCE established.\n\n**Phase 6 – Procurement and Contracting:** supplier and customer contracts finalized; project contracts established; purchasing completed; necessary permits in place.\n\n**Phase 7 – Construction, Commissioning and Start-up**\n\nIf the first six phases are completed successfully, then phase 7, construction, commissioning and start-up should also be successful.\n\n## Market and Financial and Economic Analysis\n\nIt goes without saying that if you don't have a secure market for your product, it doesn't matter how well engineered or constructed your project is, it won't be successful. The same applies to financing and economics. No matter the success of the technology, if the project doesn't have a satisfactory return on investment, it will not be successful. Securing markets and monitoring the financial viability are paramount. Securing a market will most likely be a condition for securing financing.\n\nThe one caveat to the above statements are projects that are supported by governments who deem that the project is socially desirable and are willing to subsidize the construction and operation of the plant, and in some cases the entire industry.\n\n## Risk\n\nRisk is associated with every venture, and must be accounted for at each stage of the project development process. Companies with well established project development processes have a formalized 'gate' procedure that assesses risk continually through the project. At the end of each of the phases described above, risk is assessed per criteria that the company has established for determining if a project is still viable. If the criteria is met, the project passes through the 'gate' and on to the next phase of the project. If the criteria is not met, then the project is either terminated or revised until all criteria are met.\n\nThis formalized gate process limits the amount of risk to the development funds that have been expended to date. There is little or no financial risk with phases 1 and 2; increasing risk with phases 3, 4 and 5; and considerable risk with phases 6 and 7, where the greatest amount of funds are expended. Hence, the criteria to pass the gate beyond phase 5 should be quite strict. However, if phases 1 through 5 have been conducted properly, and the risks have been identified and can be accommodated, then risk is minimized.\n\nCutting the project development process short and trying to make the leap from feasibility phase 2 to phase 6 or 7 increases the risk substantially.\n\n## Financing\n\nThe 'person' controlling the funds has control of the project. If you are fortunate to have enough funds that you can finance the entire project yourself, you can develop it and run it anyway you want. However, most developers work with someone else's money. This could be a single investor, a group of investors, or a bank or other lending institution.\n\nWorking with investor's money means that you will be subject to some form of accountability, which will require developing the project to a recognized development process. You will likely need a 'bankable' study which will define not only the project and business plan, but will identify the risks. Likely the lender will require that the study be prepared by a reputable third party who is knowledgeable in both the plant process and the project development process. Most often the third party is an engineering company or a construction company.\n\n## Engineering\n\nThe amount of engineering undertaken depends upon the stage you are at in the development process. You don't want to do any more engineering than is required to satisfy the requirements of the current development phase. For example, you would not do detail design until you knew the project was technically and financially viable and you had MOU's in place with most of the stakeholders.\n\nThe cost of engineering can vary significantly depending upon the type of project or study. As a 'rule of thumb', expect that the total cost for the detail design of a conventional project will be in the range of 10-15% of the total direct costs.\n\nSometimes in an effort to defray the up-front costs, an entrepreneur will attempt to push the engineering onto the equipment vendors or contractors, who then hide the engineering in their overall pricing. However, it is the author's experience that vendors are not best suited to determine the most applicable process technology; there is an unavoidable bias in favour of supplying their own equipment and systems.\n\nNor are vendors the best ones to establish construction costs. They don't have the in-house expertise or the specific knowledge of the area where the project is to be constructed and often provide grossly inaccurate construction allowances.\n\nThe engineering must be done by someone; but the vendor's interests are not the same as the Owner's. As is to be expected, the vendor wants to minimize his costs and maximize his profits, and to do so, will often sacrifice technological requirements in order to reduce his costs such as simple things like making chutes too shallow or conveyors too steep.\n\nThe Owner wants to get good value; the most appropriate equipment for the lowest cost. Utilizing an Owner's engineer ensures that the owner's interests are first and foremost at all times.\n\n## Capital Cost Estimating\n\nYou will have to establish suitable capital cost estimates for each phase of the project. The amount of effort required for each phase varies; but you need to do enough work to believe in the accuracy of the estimate. A capital cost estimate for the total installed project cost includes direct costs, indirect costs and contingency; and may, or may not provide for escalation.\n\n### Direct Costs\n\nDirect costs are 'hard' project costs which usually include work done in the following disciplines:\n\n- Civil and Structural Work, including site preparation, roads, underground services, foundations, buildings, etc.\n- Mechanical and Piping Work, including process equipment and systems\n- Electrical and Instrumentation Work, including electrical power and control systems\n- Other disciplines depending upon the type of project\n\nDirect costs include the following for each discipline:\n\n- Direct purchase price of goods or service, including equipment purchases\n- Installation contractor purchases, including concrete, steel, tool rentals, sub-contractors\n- Contractor installation labour\n\n### Indirect Costs\n\nIndirect costs are 'soft' project costs that are not included in direct costs and could include allowances for such things as:\n\n- Engineering\n- Owner's development costs\n- Construction management\n- Construction living out allowance and travel, if the project is in a remote location\n- Temporary construction facilities\n- Construction insurance\n- Vendor equipment erection supervision\n- Commissioning and start-up assistance and training\n- Premium labour costs (overtime)\n- Spare parts\n- Taxes and Duties\n\nThe amount included for indirect costs depends upon company policies and the items included and can vary substantially. An average number to use is 25% of the total direct costs.\n\n### Contingency\n\nA contingency allowance should be provided in the CCE to cover those costs that are unforeseen at the time the estimate is produced and may become apparent as detailed design and construction proceed. The contingency is not intended to provide for costs associated with scope changes.\n\nThe amount of contingency to allow depends upon company policy, which should consider the amount of engineering and procurement work undertaken to produce the CCE and can vary between 5% and 25% of total direct and indirect costs. The greater the project has been defined, the lower the contingency required.\n\n## Accuracy of Capital Cost Estimate\n\nThe accuracy of a capital cost estimate depends upon the amount of engineering and procurement effort undertaken to establish the costs.\n\n**Phase 1 – Pre-feasibility Study**\n- Class 50-75 CCE\n- No engineering done\n- No procurement activities done\n- 'best intelligent guess at costs'\n\n**Phase 2 – Feasibility Study**\n- Class 40-50 CCE\n- ~ 1% of engineering completed\n- Historical data used for CCE and maybe a few verbal price quotations\n\n**Phase 3 – Definition Study**\n- Class 25 CCE\n- 5-10% of engineering completed\n- Technical specifications developed and +/-25% budget price quotations received\n- Preliminary discussions with contractors regarding unit pricing\n\n**Phase 4 – Budget Development**\n- Class 10 CCE\n- 25-35% of engineering completed\n- +/-10% budget prices obtained\n\n**Phase 5 – Detail Design**\n- 90-100% of engineering is completed\n\n**Phase 6 – Procurement and Contracting**\n- Firm equipment and contract pricing is obtained\n- Class 5 CCE accounting budget is set\n\n### Cost Estimate Definitions\n\nOne definition for the different classes of cost estimates is as follows. eg. – a Class 25 CCE is one in which there is a >90% probability that the estimated capital cost will not exceed 125% of the estimated value.\n\nA more common definition is: a Class 25 CCE is one in which the costs are within +/-25% of the estimated value. The author believes that this definition is not as reliable. It is his experience that projects are rarely less than the estimated value; and if they are, it is likely that the cost was over-estimated in the first place.\n\n## Project Execution\n\nThere are many types of project arrangements; however, following are simple descriptions of the (3) most common.\n\n### Conventional Projects\n\n- The client selects an Owner's engineer who performs a minimum of project phases 1-3 and as high as phase 6.\n- Engineering can be on a 'cost plus mark-up' or firm price basis. The cost plus basis usually provides the best value.\n- Often, the client is very familiar with the technical process.\n- If he wishes, the client can exercise considerable control all the way through the project.\n- Usually the equipment purchases and contracts are made by or in the client's name.\n- The client obtains financing for the project and assumes all risk.\n- This type of project usually results in the lowest total capital cost.\n\n### EPCM Projects\n\n- In addition to engineering and procurement functions, the Owner's engineer takes on the added responsibility of construction management and may or may not assume some of the project risk.\n\n### EPC Projects\n\n- Sometimes called 'turn-key' or 'design-build' projects.\n- The client selects a knowledgeable Owner's engineer, who looks after the client's best interests throughout the project. He will usually perform project phases 1-3 or 4, providing conceptual design and a Class 10-25 CCE and then will develop a performance-based EPC tender document, which is issued to selected companies.\n- The selected companies provide firm-price bids for (1) functioning plant.\n- The client establishes a single contract with one entity to provide the plant.\n- The Owner's engineer monitors the progress of the selected EPC contractor's work.\n- The Contractor obtains financing and assumes all risk, until the plant is complete, performance requirements have been met and the plant has been turned over to the client.","src/content/posts/so-you-want-to-build-a-biomass-plant.md","8ced8d458eddce0b",{"html":693,"metadata":694},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>A Beginner’s Guide to the Project Development Process\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>An edited version of this article appeared in the November / December 2011 issue of Bioenergy Insight magazine, under the title “Building a Biomass Plant”.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You have a good idea for a new way to manufacture a product.
